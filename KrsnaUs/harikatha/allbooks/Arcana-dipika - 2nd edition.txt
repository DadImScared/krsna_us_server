For the English Edition

The title of this book, Arcana-dīpikā, means “the lamp
that illuminates arcana.” The term arcana signifies
honor or worship. It is one of the nine processes of
devotional service, and refers to worshiping the Deity
form of the Lord. Arcana-dīpikā teaches us exactly how
this service is performed and how to please the Lord
through this process of worship. By the mercy of Śrī
Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the Six Gosvāmīs and other
contemporary followers of Śrīman Mahāprabhu, and more
recently, Śrīla A.C. Bhaktivedānta Svāmī Mahārāja, the
process of Deity worship, which is the authentic method
of approaching Śrī Bhagavān, has been successfully
introduced to the entire world. Arcana-dīpikā was
originally presented in Bengali by Śrīla Bhaktivedānta
Vāmana Gosvāmī Mahārāja and then translated into Hindi
by Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Nārāyaṇa Gosvāmī Mahārāja. Those
versions were written for a readership already familiar
with some of the methods and procedures of arcana. In
this translation, the English edition, we have included
supplementary explanations for the understanding of
those who are unfamiliar with the Vedic culture and the
traditional methodology used in the process of arcana.
Additionally, because the Vedic system is orthodox and
may appear extremely rigid from the perspective of
people of other backgrounds, as far as possible we have
tried to organize and simplify the procedures while
preserving the original method.

Here, we must include a word of caution. Although
Arcana-dīpikā teaches the process of worshiping the
Deity, arcana cannot be practiced by merely following
this book. In order to practice arcana in its pure form,
in such a way that it awakens bhakti, one needs to be
initiated by a bona fide spiritual master. It is by the
grace of such a pure devotee that a person in the
conditioned state is able to obtain the qualification to
worship the Deity of the Lord.

It is a privilege to be admitted into the circle of
those who have established a relationship with Śrī
Bhagavān and who daily offer their worship to Him. This
process of arcana is a prescribed method to easily
develop prema-bhakti, the innate propensity of the jīva
to love God. By engaging in this process under the
inspiration and guidance of śrī-guru, there is a gradual
awakening of affection in the heart for one’s
worshipable object, and the blossoming of hope to attain
śuddha-bhakti, unalloyed devotion to Kṛṣṇa.

Those new to the process of Deity worship may find this
book somewhat challenging. There are many details to the
worship and new words that could be intimidating at
first glance. We recommend that you read the book
through once and get an overview of the entire system.
To make the book more user friendly, we have added our
footnotes for further clarity, and there is a glossary
to help you learn the different terms. We have also
included separate, laminated reference cards in the back
of the book. These cards will help by giving you step-
by-step procedures for different aspects of the worship
without having to constantly refer to the book. As you
begin to perform the worship regularly, most of the

                           10
Arcana-dipika.txt                              5/5/2017

procedures will quickly become second nature to you. We
pray that this edition of Arcana-dīpikā meets the
standard of worship shown in the original Hindi edition
and is accessible for the English speaking devotees who
use it.

The Editors




Introduction

It is enjoined in the śāstras, “sampradāya-vihīnā ye
mantrās te viphalā matāḥ – Mantras which are not
received from a guru-paramparā, or bona fide disciplic
succession, yield no result.” The chanting of such
inauthentic mantras does not lead to perfection.
Therefore, Śrī Bhagavān, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, the embodiment of all auspiciousness, has
displayed unlimited compassion towards the jīvas of
Kali-yuga by introducing the topmost process of sādhana-
bhajana. In this age of Kali, our sole object of
consideration for the benefit of the Śrī Gauḍīya
Vaiṣṇava community in the line of Madhvācārya is the
process of worship, especially the rules and regulations
recommended by the original Supreme Personality of
Godhead Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the saviour of the
fallen souls. These teachings of Śrīman Mahāprabhu have
been presented to us in the form of authorized śāstras
through the medium of Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, Sanātana
Gosvāmī, Jīva Gosvāmī, Gopāla-bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī and other
Vaiṣṇava ācāryas.

Śrī Bhagavān Himself is the only worshipable object of
the Vaiṣṇavas. Only those who are initiated into the
viṣṇu-mantras, in other words, who have received viṣṇu-
dīkṣā, and who engage in the worship of Viṣṇu are
Vaiṣṇavas. Therefore, the acceptance of viṣṇu-dīkṣā and
the consequent engagement in the worship of Viṣṇu is the
primary symptom of Vaiṣṇavism. It is imperative for an
initiated person to embrace and relish the prescribed
conduct and obligatory duties of the Vaiṣṇavas, which
have been presented upon the merciful order of Śrī
Caitanya Mahāprabhu by the Vaiṣṇava ācāryas in the form
of fresh butter churned from the śastra-ocean. It is
mentioned in various śastras that all people from the
four varṇas and āśramas have the right to become
Vaiṣṇavas by accepting the viṣṇu-mantras and then
engaging in the worship of Viṣṇu. All the fruitive
endeavors of an uninitiated person are meaningless.

Due to not having received viṣṇu-dīkṣā, such a person
has not established a relationship with Śrī Bhagavān and
therefore cannot be acknowledged as a bona fide
Vaiṣṇava. Only when sambandha-jñāna, or knowledge of
one’s relationship with the Lord, awakens after
undergoing the regulative principle of initiation
(dīkṣā-saṁskāra) and receiving the viṣṇu-mantras in
accordance with the śāstric injunctions is one genuinely
established as a true Vaiṣṇava. The chanting of the
mahā-mantra does not depend upon any rule or regulation
related to the formal acceptance of initiation. If we

                           11
Arcana-dipika.txt                              5/5/2017

can attain perfection simply by chanting the names of
Śrī Bhagavān, what, then, is the need of accepting
formal initiation? Many people have the misconception
that there is no need.

The process of dīkṣā awakens in the heart of the jīva as
a particular relationship with Śrī Bhagavān. By the
influence of that relationship, ignorance of one’s
constitutional identity (avidyā) and other unwanted
habits and thoughts (anarthas) vanish in sequence.
Without undergoing upanayana, the purificatory procedure
(saṁskāra) of receiving a sacred thread, the son of a
brāhmaṇa does not possess the eligibility to study the
Vedas. It is only after receiving this reformatory
process of accepting dīkṣā initiation (upanayana) that
he obtains the necessary eligibility. Similarly, an
uninitiated person does not possess the necessary
qualification to perform the worship of Śrī Bhagavān.
Only after accepting dīkṣā does he obtain the
eligibility. Transcendental knowledge awakens in one’s
heart by the effect of receiving dīkṣā, and he truly
becomes a human being. Dīkṣā-saṁskāra enlightens one in
transcendental knowledge (dīvya-jñānam) and destroys
one’s accumulation of unlimited sins (pāpa-saṅkṣā).
Therefore, those who know the truth call this process
‘dīkṣā.’ As a chemical reaction turns bronze into gold,
by receiving dīkṣā a person attains the status of being
twice-born. Hence, it is imperative to accept initiation
and thus establish a particular relationship with Śrī
Bhagavān. By destroying the sins and sufferings of a
weak-hearted jīva and by purifying and enlightening him,
the process of dīkṣā first elevates him to the material
mode of goodness (sattva-guṇa) and ultimately
establishes him in the stage of transcendence.

Guru-pādāśrayas tasmāt kṛṣṇa-dīkṣādi śikṣaṇam – it is
one’s foremost duty to take shelter of the lotus feet of
a sad-guru, who is thoroughly established in a bona fide
disciplic succession, and then accept initiation from
him. The guru is non-different from a manifestation of
Śrī Hari. Bhagavān Śrī Hari Himself is the guru of all
jīvas. If the guru is pleased with someone, Śrī Bhagavān
will also be pleased with that person. If Bhagavān is
displeased with someone, he can still be protected by a
sad-guru, but if the guru is displeased with someone,
then even Śrī Bhagavān cannot protect him. Guru-kṛpā, or
the mercy of the guru, is the exclusive hope for a
person who has taken shelter of him. Gurus can be
classified into three categories: śravaṇa-guru, dīkṣā-
guru, and śikṣā-guru. Śrī guru, the worshipable Deity
(Bhagavān), and the mantra serve the same purpose. One
who considers them to be separate will not attain
perfection. Hence, by understanding guru-tattva in truth
and thus accepting shelter of the guru’s lotus feet as
recommended in the śāstras, one is sure to be liberated
from the bondage of material existence. By taking
shelter of the lotus feet of a sad-guru, a jīva can
achieve the topmost goal (parama-puruṣārtha).

Those who have taken shelter of the lotus feet of a sad-
guru and received dīkṣā from him realise that Śrī
Bhagavān is the Supreme Lord and everyone’s worshipable
Deity. Amongst the sixty-four limbs of bhakti, the nine-
fold limbs of devotion (navadhā-bhakti) and the five-

                           12
Arcana-dipika.txt                              5/5/2017

fold limbs of devotion (pañcāṅga-bhakti), devotion
constantly accompanied by the performance of kīrtana
(kīrtanākhyā-bhakti) is described as being the topmost.
Yadyapy anyā-bhaktiḥ kalau kartavyā, tadā kīrtanākhyā
bhakti-samyogenaiva – this statement shows the supremacy
of kīrtanākhyā-bhakti in the age of Kali. Still, in
order to remove the weakness of heart and mundane
conceptions of a kaniṣṭha-adhikārī, or neophyte devotee,
who is initiated into the viṣṇu-mantra, arcana is
specifically required. Therefore, for the convenience
and benefit of devotees engaged in arcana, this Arcana-
dīpikā is being published. It considers the distinctions
and special characteristics of the births known as
śaukra (birth from semen), sāvitrya (receiving the
sacred thread from a brāhmaṇa) and daikṣya (initiation
into the viṣṇu-mantras by a bona fide guru). It also
establishes through śāstric evidence and reasoning that
only those who are initiated into the viṣṇu-mantras have
the eligibility to perform arcana of Bhagavān and that
their arcana becomes complete and perfect only when
accompanied by the performance of kīrtana of the mahā-
mantra.

A jīva can never achieve liberation from the
entanglement of the material energy if he disregards the
loving devotional service of Bhagavān. Therefore, the
process for performing arcana of Śrī Bhagavān has been
established on the basis of Śrī Nārada-pañcarātra and
other Smṛtis. The Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam recommends that
after receiving the viṣṇu-mantras from a sad-guru and
learning the procedure of arcana from him, one should
worship his favourite Deity of Bhagavān Śrī Hari.

The consciousness of the conditioned soul is very
flickering and similar to that of an ignorant child.
Only by the mercy of the ācārya does he develop a
reverential attitude towards the transcendental Deity
and become fortunate to receive instruction on the
worship of Śrī Viṣṇu, who is non-dual, or one without a
second (advaya). Those who are adverse to service to Śrī
Hari disregard the path of arcana and instead engage in
the activities of karma and the cultivation of jñāna. On
the other hand, those who perform arcana according to
the rules of pāñcarātrika know bhakti-yoga to be the
topmost. Impurity exists in any endeavour devoid of the
worship of Śrī Bhagavān. In the absence of a proper
relationship with Bhagavān, one tends to worship many
demigods. In such consciousness, one cannot properly
perform the arcana of Śrī Hari. Those attached to
household life have envious natures and agitated minds.
Due to this, they become entangled in various types of
imaginary paths and disrespect the arcana process. When
the jīva becomes free from the influence of his material
ego and accepts his eternal occupation of servitude,
then his worshipable Śrī Bhagavān manifests before him
in the form of a Deity to accept his service. Yena
janma-śataiḥ pūrvaṁ vāsudevaḥ samarcitaḥ, tan-mukhe
hari-nāmāni sadā tiṣṭhanti bhārata. The exalted devotees
of Śrī Bhagavān have commented on this verse as follows:
To achieve the eligibility to genuinely enter nāma-
bhajana, the jīva must first be elevated from the
kaniṣṭha-adhikārī stage to the madhyama-adhikārī stage
by rendering service to the Deity form of Bhagavān
(arcāvatāra). The process of Deity worship has been

Arcana-dipika.txt                              5/5/2017

mentioned in both the Pañcarātra and the Bhāgavatam.
Therefore, the Supreme Personality of Godhead Śrī
Caitanya Mahāprabhu has said:

kṛṣṇa-mantra haite habe saṁsāra-mocana

kṛṣṇa-nāma haite pābe kṛṣṇera caraṇa

Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta (ādi-līlā 7.73)

One can obtain freedom from material existence simply by
chanting the kṛṣṇa-mantra. Indeed, by chanting kṛṣṇa-
nāma one obtains Kṛṣṇa’s lotus feet.

As long as a devotee remains a kaniṣṭha-adhikārī, he
cannot realise the supramundane or transcendental
position of Bhagavān’s eternal devotees. By faithfully
worshiping the Deity of Vāsudeva [Śrī Kṛṣṇa] with the
help of various items, he gradually realises the
intrinsic nature of the transcendental name and mantra,
which consequently diminishes his mundane conceptions.
Apart from the arcā-vigraha, the Deity of Bhagavān, the
jīva maintains an intense enjoying tendency towards all
other perceivable objects. Therefore, in order to
enhance his reverential attitude towards Śrī Bhagavān,
the neophyte devotee is recommended to perform all of
his endeavours for Bhagavān’s pleasure while
simultaneously completely renouncing other activities.
While performing arcana, one must focus his attention on
the arcā-vigraha and the process of arcana itself. By
advancing in the process of arcana, one enters into the
realm of bhajana (spontaneous devotional meditation).
Although the process of arcana is not the priority in
bhajana, still, bhajana is not opposed to the
reverential service attitude required for arcana. In
fact, the arcā-vigraha is a special incarnation of
Bhagavān. Bhagavān’s incarnations appear in this world
at certain times, but both the Supersoul and the arcā-
vigraha can be realised at all times by the process of
loving devotional service. There is a basic difference
between arcana and bhajana. While arcana is an activity
performed with a reverential attitude, bhajana may
appear to transgress such a reverential path. Still, by
taking complete shelter of the chanting of hari-nāma,
bhajana is in itself a complete process of exclusive
devotional service to Bhagavān.

By performing arcana of Bhagavān, one soon feels immense
pleasure within oneself, which is the cause of all
varieties of perfections and auspiciousness. Without
performing arcana, it is not possible for a person
attached to material enjoyment to break free from bad
association and so forth. Śrī Bhagavān Himself instructs
us on the process of His arcana through the guidelines
given in the śastras. Moreover, great sages like Brahmā,
Śiva, Nārada, Vyāsa, and others have recommended this
process as the most beneficial for the supreme welfare
of all individuals situated within the varṇāśrama
system, including women and śūdras.

Arcana is classified under three categories – vaidika,
or that which is prescribed in Vedas, the tāntrika, or
that which is taught in the Tantras, and miśra, or
mixed. The altar or sacrificial arena, fire, the sun,

                           14

water, and the heart are either places of arcana or
objects of arcana. The Deity can be of eight kinds:
carved from stone, carved from wood, made of clay,
paint, sand, jewels, gold or other alloys, or mentally
conceived. Furthermore, the Deity can also be either
moveable or stationary. Bathing the Deity with mantras,
worshipping the Deity at the different sandhyās
(intervals), cleansing the Deity, changing the Deity’s
clothes and decorating the Deity with ornaments,
sprinkling purified water on the different instruments
and ingredients employed in arcana, offering pādya
(ingredients used for bathing the Deity’s feet), arghya-
ācamanīya (ingredients used for washing the mouth),
incense, scents, a lamp, flowers, food, worshipping the
Deity’s eternal devotees in the guru-paramparā, chanting
the mūla-mantra, the recitation of hymns, offering
prostrated obeisances, reciting prayers and honouring
the garlands, candana (sandalwood paste), flowers, and
other items offered to the Deity are limbs of arcana.
Constructing a temple for the proper installation of the
Deity, organizing processions, and observing festivals
related to the Deity are also integral limbs of arcana.
Thus, by performing arcana unto Śrī Hari with single-
minded pure devotion (bhakti-yoga), one attains loving
devotional service to His lotus feet.

Being a special avatāra of Bhagavān, the Deity
captivates the faith of the arcaka, the devotee who
performs arcana, and bestows auspiciousness upon him.
Those who consider the arcā-vigraha to be composed of
certain structural ingredients and maintain an enjoying
mentality towards Him have no faith in Bhagavān Śrī
Viṣṇu. If anyone considers Bhagavān to be an object of
his enjoyment and pretentiously engages in arcana, then
certainly he possesses either very weak faith or no
faith at all. With great faith one should perform the
worship of the Deity of Bhagavān with sixteen varieties
of paraphernalia. Sincere household devotees should
worship Śrī Bhagavān with the best ingredients. The
uttama-adhikārīs or premī-bhaktas, those who have
developed great love for Bhagavān, are beyond the rules
and regulations of varṇāśrama. Being immersed in their
mood of intense devotion, they perform worship endowed
with ecstatic emotions (bhāva-sevā), with easily
attainable ingredients. On the other hand, wealthy
household-devotees should worship the Deity with the
best ingredients and observe various devotional
festivals according to their capacity. Behaving in a
miserly fashion in this regard makes one wicked, and
consequently his service-attitude begins to deteriorate.

It is stated in the Śrī Hari-bhakti-vilāsa:

kṛtyānyetāni tu prāyo gṛhiṇāṁ dhanāni satām

likhitāni na tu tyakta-parigraha-mahātmanām

Mentioned herein are obligatory duties concerning the
process of arcana which are recommended for wealthy,
virtuous householders. They do not pertain to fully
renounced sages.

Lastly, I would like to submit that although I am
completely unworthy, I am being presented as the editor

Chapter One

The Deity and the Process of Worship



Śrī Arcā and Arcana

To bestow causeless mercy upon the jīvas, the supremely
compassionate svayaṁ-bhagavān Śrī Kṛṣṇa is perpetually
manifest in this illusory material world in two forms:
as the worshipful Deity (śrī-arcā-vigraha) and as the
holy name (śrī-harināma). The Deity of Bhagavān is non-
different from His eternal form. Therefore, it is
mentioned in the Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta, “pratimā naha
tumi, sākṣāt vrajendra-nandana – My dear Lord, You are
not a statue; You are directly the son of Mahārāja
Nanda.” The arcā-vigraha of Śrī Kṛṣṇa is none other than
Vrajendra-nandana Śrī Kṛṣṇa Himself. Despite being non-
different, there exists a mutual distinction between the
two on the basis of Their variegated pastimes. In the
spotless Purāṇa, the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (11.27.12), eight
types of Deity forms have been mentioned:

śailī dārumayī lauhī lepyā lekhyā ca saikatī

manomayī maṇimayī pratimāṣṭa-vidhā smṛtā

The Deity of Śrī Bhagavān is of the following eight
types: (1) carved from marble or stone, (2) carved from
wood, (3) made of iron, gold, or any other alloy, (4)
made from clay, (5) painted, (6) made of sand, (7)
mentally conceived, and (8) made of gems, pearls, or
jewels.

It is a great offense to consider the Deity of Śrī
Bhagavān to be a mundane idol, doll, or puppet.
Atheistic concepts such as thinking that the Deity is
made out of stone, wood, or any other alloy and then
assigned the identity of Bhagavān, or that the spiritual
Absolute Truth has appeared in this material form, or
that this material form has been transformed into a
transcendental object, comprise the road leading to
hell. The scriptures describe those who maintain such
ideas as nārakī, or destined for residence in hell.

arcye viṣṇau śilā-dhīr guruṣu nara-matir vaiṣṇave jāti-
buddhir

viṣṇor vā vaiṣṇavānāṁ kali-mala-mathane pāda-tīrthe
‘mbu-buddhiḥ

śrī-viṣṇor nāmni mantre sakala-kaluṣahe śabda-sāmānya-
buddhir

viṣṇau sarveśvareśe tad-itara-sama-dhīr yasya vā nārakī
saḥ

Padma Purāṇa

A person is destined for residence in hell who considers
the Deity to be made out of wood, stone, or any alloy,

                           24
Arcana-dipika.txt                                5/5/2017

who considers the guru, who is an eternal devotee of
Bhagavān, to be an ordinary human who is subject to
death, who considers a Vaiṣṇava to belong to a
particular caste or creed, who considers caraṇāmṛta,
water which has washed the feet of Śrī Viṣṇu and the
Vaiṣṇavas, to be ordinary water, though in reality it
destroys the evils of the age of Kali, who considers the
holy name and the mantra of Śrī Viṣṇu, which destroy all
types of sinful reaction, to be ordinary material sound
vibrations, and who considers the supreme controller Śrī
Viṣṇu to be equal to the many demigods.

When with a reverential attitude one performs the
worship of the Deity form with various articles
according to the guidelines of the Pañcarātra, this is
called arcana. Though externally the arcana performed by
the neophyte devotees (kaniṣṭha-adhikārī) and the loving
service of the Deity performed by the highest class of
devotees like Śrī Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī appear
similar, they can never be the same in excellence. In
the arcana

performed by a neophyte devotee, there exists the
conception of ‘I’ and ‘Mine’ towards his gross and
subtle bodies. In the loving service (bhāva-sevā) of
devotees following the path of rāgānuga-bhakti, there is
a direct service relationship between the pure soul and
Bhagavān, who is beyond the reach of the mundane senses
and the material elements found within the creation.

Constitutionally the jīva is an eternal servant of
Bhagavān, but due to becoming adverse to Bhagavān, he
identifies himself with the material body. Since time
immemorial he wanders throughout the universe, suffering
the threefold miseries in higher and lower species of
life. As long as the jīva remains opposed to Bhagavān,
he will not achieve Bhagavān and he will remain
imprisoned in the jailhouse of the illusory energy. When
in his heart a fortunate jīva becomes inclined towards
serving Bhagavān, only then is he able to attain Śrī
Kṛṣṇa’s eternal association. Hence, the inclination to
serve Bhagavān by performing bhagavad-bhakti is the only
means to attain Him. This is the irrefutable conclusion
unanimously accepted by the Śrutis, Smṛtis, Upaniṣads,
Purāṇas, Pañcarātra and all other scriptures.

Arcana is counted as one of the ninefold limbs of
devotion mentioned in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam:

śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam

arcanaṁ vandanaṁ dāsyaṁ sakhyam ātma-nivedanam

Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam (7.5.23)

The nine activities of hearing, chanting, and
remembering the transcendental names, forms, qualities
and pastimes of Śrī Viṣṇu, serving His lotus feet,
worshipping Him, offering prayers to Him, becoming His
servant, considering Him one’s best friend, and
surrendering one’s very soul unto Him, are accepted as
pure devotional service.

Arcana is also one of the fivefold limbs of devotion

                             25
Arcana-dipika.txt                                 5/5/2017

men-tioned in both Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu and Caitanya-
caritāmṛta:

śraddhā viśeṣataḥ prītiḥ śrī-mūrter aṅghri-sevane

śrīmad-bhāgavatārthānām āsvādo rasikaiḥ saha

sajātīyāśaye snigdhe sādhau saṅgaḥ svato vare

nāma-saṅkīrtanaṁ śrīman-mathurā-maṇḍale sthitiḥ

Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu (2.86.61)

One should lovingly worship the lotus feet of the Deity
with full faith, one should taste the meaning of the
Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam in the association of rasika
Vaiṣṇavas, one should associate with devotees who are
more advanced than oneself, who possess similar
sentiments for Bhagavān and who are affectionately
disposed towards oneself, one should chant harināma in
the association of devotees, and one should reside
within the jurisdiction of Mathurā.

sādhu-saṅga, nāma-kīrtana, bhāgavat-śravaṇa

mathurā-vāsa, śrī-mūrtira śraddhāya sevana

sakala sādhana-śreṣṭha ei pañca aṅga

kṛṣṇa-prema janmāya ei pāñcera alpa-saṅga

Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta (Madhya-līlā 22.128, 129)

One should remain in the association of advanced
devotees, chant harināma in their association, hear
Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam from them, reside in Mathurā, and
worship the Deity with faith and devotion. These five
limbs of bhakti are the topmost because even a slight
execution of them causes the awakening of kṛṣṇa-prema.

Śrī-nāma-saṅkīrtana alone is the religious process of
this age (yuga-dharma). One can achieve the ultimate
perfection of kṛṣṇa-prema only through the performance
of unnalloyed cultivation of the holy name (śrī-nāma-
bhajana). Cultivatation of the holy name does not even
require any formal initiation into mantras and so forth.
However, to minimise the self-degrading tendencies of
those who possess covetous natures and agitated minds
due to their conditioning in subtle and gross bodies,
Śrī Nārada and other great sages have in different
scriptures prescribed regulations for the acceptance of
initiation (dīkṣā) and special guidelines for the
performance of Deity worship (arcana).

There are also rules for atonement in cases where
initiated devotees have either disregarded or
transgressed the vows taken at the time of dīkṣā and the
guidelines for performing arcana. Thus, in all Vaiṣṇava
sampradāyas there are provisions to eradicate the
covetous natures and agitated minds of devotees who have
received initiation and are therefore qualified to
perform arcana. These provisions are none other than the
particular systematic arrangements for those who have
accepted śrī-mahā-mantra initiation and dīkṣā to perform

                           26
Arcana-dipika.txt                              5/5/2017

arcana.

During the process of arcana, Bhagavān’s holy name
always remains the prime factor. The performance of
kīrtana of the holy names of the Lord is the life and
soul of arcana. Deity worship which is devoid of nāma-
saṅkīrtana does not yield any result. Especially in
Kali-yuga, it is prescribed that one perform not only
arcana but all limbs of bhakti with the support of
kīrtana. Therefore, from the time of waking the Deity
until the time one offers Him flowers before He goes to
sleep at night, in all of the activities of arcana one
must perform śrī-nāma-saṅkīrtana.

All revealed scriptures and saintly persons unanimously
proclaim that upon receiving formal initiation
(pañcarātrika-dīkṣā) from a bona fide spiritual master,
whether one is a brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra, or
even from the sakara and antyaja castes (untouchables,
both male and female), one obtains the eligibility to
perform arcana of śrī-śālagrāma-śilā and all other Deity
forms of Bhagavān. An uninitiated person does not
possess the eligibility to perform arcana. By accepting
formal initiation from a bona fide spiritual master,
one’s spiritual qualification to worship the
transcendental Supreme Personality of Godhead is
established. This is the unanimous conclusion of all
revealed scriptures. Such an initiated person alone is
factually qualified to worship and serve Śrī Viṣṇu. It
is the duty of an initiated householder (gṛhastha) to
faithfully perform arcana of the śrī-vigraha. Otherwise,
there remains every possibility of falling down from
spiritual life due to being covetous or miserly.

Arcana is of two types: japāṅga-arcana and bhaktyaṅga-
arcana. Arcana performed with the purpose of attaining
perfection in the chanting of mantras is called japāṅga-
arcana. This japāṅga-arcana is included within the
category of karma or fruitive activity. The arcana
performed by the mundane ritualistic followers of the
Vedas (smārtas) who desire to enjoy the fruits of their
activities is japāṅga-arcana and is not a limb of
bhakti. Arcana lovingly performed solely for Bhagavān’s
pleasure and for the enhancement of one’s devotion is a
limb of bhakti and direct service to Bhagavān. The
arcana performed by unalloyed pure devotees in the line
of Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī (rūpānugas) is bhaktyaṅga-arcana.
It is improper to employ the processes of japāṅga,
prāṇāyāma (breath control), nyāsa (mental assignment of
different parts of the body to various deities), mudrā
(particular positions of intertwining the fingers) and
so forth in that arcana of Bhagavān which is included
within nine-fold (navadhā) and five-fold (pañcadhā)
bhakti. This is because the Deity being worshiped by a
pure devotee is directly Bhagavān Himself and is
perpetually manifest.

The above-mentioned bhaktyaṅga-arcana is also of two
kinds: (1) the worship of śrī-śālagrāma-śilā, śrī-
govardhana-śilā or any other Deity form of Bhagavān
performed by householders in their homes, and (2) the
worship of formally installed Deities of Bhagavān,
either ancient or modern, in separate temples for the
purpose of performing or preaching the glories of

                           27
Arcana-dipika.txt                              5/5/2017

bhagavat-sevā. The first kind is simple worship that
depends on the availability of paraphernalia according
to one’s means, whereas the second kind is rāja-sevā or
a royal standard of worship. In the royal standard, the
worship must be performed daily without fail. Any
irregularity makes the worship faulty and offensive. The
worship of the Deity should be performed solely for the
pleasure of Bhagavān. Neophyte devotees perform arcana
as an obligatory duty.

In rāja-sevā, one must learn to tolerate the various
hardships to be faced while executing the rules and
regulations of arcana. With resolute determination one
must not allow the hardships born of following the rules
and regulations according to time, place, and
circumstance to deviate him from the faithful execution
of his service. While performing rāja-sevā, both
sannyāsīs as well as gṛhasthas can vary the quantity of
bhoga offerings to the Deity depending on the
requirements of family, Vaiṣṇavas, guests, and visitors.
Even on fasting days one must offer grains to the Deity,
but must not accept those offered grains oneself. Those
grains can be taken the next day or given to someone who
is not fasting. One should perform worship favourably
according to the different seasons and should also offer
the Deity of Bhagavān seasonal fruits, grains, sweets,
and so on. It is obligatory to remain extremely careful
not to commit any sevā-aparādha.

The five limbs of arcana (paÑcāṅga-arcana)

Generally there are five limbs of arcana. This is also
known as pañcāṅga-viṣṇu-yajña, the five-fold sacrifice
performed for the pleasure of Viṣṇu. It includes various
services beginning from the awakening of the Deity in
the brāhma-muhūrta until His flower offering at the time
of resting at night (śayana-puṣpāñjali). The five limbs
are abhigamana, upādāna, yoga, svādhyāya, and ijyā.

Abhigamana: cleansing the Deity’s temple, anointing the
Deity with colours and sandlewood paste (candana), and
at night removing the garlands, flowers, and so forth
which have been offered to the Deity.

Upādāna: picking flowers and tulasī leaves, and
gathering incense and the various items required for
worship.

Yoga-bhūta-śuddhi: meditating on oneself as a purely
spiritual eternal servant of Śrī Kṛṣṇa in the
transcendental realm of Vraja, beyond the material body
and mind.

Svādhyāya: meditating on the meaning of harināma and the
mantras received at the time of dīkṣā while chanting
them, performing kīrtana, reciting verses and prayers,
performing congregational chanting, studying and
following the scriptures such as Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,
Caitanya-caritāmṛta, and other bhakti-śastras that are
endowed with true siddhānta.

Ijyā: serving one’s worshipable Deity in various ways.

This pañcāṅga-arcana is not a temporary, mundane

                           28
Arcana-dipika.txt                                 5/5/2017

activity, but an eternal, supremely pure limb of bhakti
which helps one to attain the lotus feet of Śrī
Bhagavān. For the benefit of Vaiṣṇavas who accept the
conclusions of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, this Arcana-dīpikā,
which is in complete accordance with the teachings of
Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī’s followers (rūpānugas), has been
compiled in summary form from Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī’s
vaiṣṇava-smṛti Śrī Hari-bhakti-vilāsa, and from the
literature, essays, and instructions of various saintly
mahājanas.




Chapter Two

Activities performed during the early morning period

(Brāhma-muhūrta-kṛtya / Nitya-Kṛtya)

Brāhma-muhūrta

One daṇḍa comprises twenty four minutes and two daṇḍas,
or forty eight minutes, comprise one muhūrta. In one
complete day of twenty-four hours, there are thirty
muhūrtas. In the last part of the night, the segment of
time consisting of the two muhūrtas (one hour and
thirty-six minutes) before sunrise, is called aruṇodaya,
or dawn. The first of these two muhūrtas is called the
brāhma-muhūrta. This brāhma-muhūrta is the most
beneficial time of the day for the cultivation of
spiritual life.

In this muhūrta one should leave the bed saying, “Śrī
Śrī Guru Gaurāṅga Śrī Śrī Rādhā Vinodabihārījī kī jaya!”
and chanting the pañca-tattva-mantra and the mahā-
mantra. Then one should brush the teeth, wash one’s
mouth, face, hands, and feet, and then bathe after
passing stool. In the case of emergency, such as
sickness, when one cannot bathe, one should at least
change into fresh clothes. Afterward, while meditating
on the lotus feet of śrī-gurudeva, one must glorify him
by chanting śrī Guru-vandanā, śrī Gurvaṣṭaka, etc. Then,
with heartfelt devotion one should chant kṛṣṇa-nāma and
recite the following prayers:

jayati jana-nivāso devakī-janma-vādo

yadu-vara-pariṣad svaiḥ dorbhir asyann adharmam

sthira-cara-vṛjina-ghnaḥ su-smita-śrī-mukhena

vraja-pura-vanitānāṁ vardhayan kāmadevam (1)

There are doubts concerning His being born from the womb
of Devakī. All glories to that Yaśodā-nandana, who
resides within the hearts of all! His assembly is
decorated with the presence of the exalted Yādavas, and
He destroys irreligion with His own might and the help
of His devotees. Despite the controversy concerning His
birth, the chanting of His name removes inauspiciousness
from all living entities, both moving and stationary.
All glories to Vrajendra-nandana Śrī Kṛṣṇa, whose softly

                           29
Arcana-dipika.txt                              5/5/2017

smiling lotus face always enhances the transcendental
lust of the vraja-gopīs.

vidagdha-gopāla-vilāsinīnāṁ

sambhoga-cihnāṅkita-sarva-gātram



pavitram āmnāya girām agamyaṁ

brahma prapadye navanīta-cauram (2)



I take shelter of that topmost relisher of rasa, the
supreme Absolute Truth Gopāla Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who on
different parts of His body bears the signs of conjugal
union with the expert gopīs, who steals butter, and who
is incomprehensible through Vedic statements.

udgāyatīnām aravinda-locananaṁ

vrajāṅganānāṁ divam aspṛśad dhvaniḥ



daghnaś ca nirmanthana-śabda-miśrito

nirasyate yena diśām amaṅgalam (3)



When mixed with the sound of churning yoghurt, the
vraja-gopīs’ loud singing of sweet and melodious songs
that glorify the name, form, qualities and pastimes of
lotus-eyed Śrī Kṛṣṇa pervades the entire atmosphere and
removes inauspiciousness in all directions.

One can also recite various other appropriate verses and
prayers at this time. Afterward, one should offer
prostrated obeisances unto Śrī Śrī Guru Gaurāṅga and Śrī
Śrī Rādhā-Vinodabihārījī.

Brushing the teeth

One should brush one’s teeth before sunrise. The dātuna
or twigs of trees with thorns are pure. The twigs of
trees with milky sap increase one’s duration of life,
while bitter and sharp twigs with a pungent taste
increase one’s happiness and prosperity. The twig should
be as thick as one’s middle finger, equal to twelve
fingers’ width in length and also must have bark. One
should hold it from its root end and brush the teeth
with the opposite end. Those who perform arcana should
properly brush their teeth even on fast days.

Bathing (snāna)

Those who are able should bathe with cold water in the
early morning. If one canít bathe with cold water, he
can bathe with luke-warm water. Before bathing one
should complete the activities of passing urine and
stool.[i]1 For bathing, well-water is good, pond-water

                              30
Arcana-dipika.txt                              5/5/2017

is better, and river-water is best. The topmost form of
bathing is performing kīrtana of Kṛṣṇaís holy names, and
remembering Kṛṣṇa. This is also known as mānasa-snāna,
or mental bath. After bathing in water, every person
must perform mānasa-snāna. The supremacy of the mānasa-
snāna is confirmed in the scriptures:

apavitraḥ pavitro vā



sarvāvasthāṁ gato ‘pi vā




yaḥ smaret puṇḍarīkākṣaṁ



sa bāhyābhyantara-śuciḥ




Garuḍa-purāṇa

Whether one is contaminated, pure, or has passed through
all conditions and stages of life, if one remembers the
lotus-eyed Lord, Puṇḍarīkākṣa, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, one becomes
pure both externally and internally.

Tying the śikhā (śikhā-bandhana)

After bathing, one should comb the hair and tie the
śikhā[ii]2 while remembering gāyatrī, along with the
syllable ‘oṁ.’ In other words, chant one time either the
brahma-gāyatrī or gopāla-mantra.

Putting on oneís cloth

After bathing, one should put on clean cloth. Unwashed
cloth, cloth which was washed many days before, cloth
washed by a washerman, dirty or contaminated cloth
(e.g., cloth stained by prasāda), wet cloth, or cloth
worn at the time of passing stool or urine cannot be
worn at the time of performing arcana to the Lord.[iii]3
It is improper to wear woolen cloth while performing
arcana, because there is always the possibility of
woolen fibres falling on the arcana paraphernalia.

Applying tilaka (tilaka-dhāraṇa)

After sitting on a clean seat called an āsana, pour
Ganges water into the pañca-pātra[iv]4 and place a
tulasī leaf in it. Taking a little of this water in the
palm of the left hand, rub into it tulasī soil from the
base of the plant.[v]5 In the absence of Ganges water,
put fresh water in the pañca-pātra and add a tulasī leaf
to it. Then, while remembering the Ganges and other
sacred rivers, touch this water and chant the following
tīrtha-āvāhana mantra to invoke the various holy rivers

                           31
Arcana-dipika.txt                              5/5/2017

to the pañca-pātra:

gaṅge ca yamune caiva

godāvari sarasvati




narmade sindho kāveri

jale ‘smin sannidhiṁ kuru




O Gaṅgā, O Yamunā, O Godāvarī, O Sarasvatī, O Narmadā, O
Sindhu, O Kāverī, please become present in this water.

Use this water and gopī-candana to form a paste in the
left hand. Then, with twelve mantras beginning with oṁ
keśavāya namaḥ, apply tilaka by forming the ūrdhva-
puṇḍra, the temple of Śrī Hari (two upwardly raised
lines) on twelve different parts of the body, starting
with the forehead.[vi]6 There must be a clean space in
the middle of the ūrdhva-puṇḍra. The centre of the
eyebrows extending three-quarters of the way down the
nose is called the nāsāmūla. Starting from the centre of
the eyebrows, form the ūrdhva-puṇḍra on the forehead
reaching up to the beginning of the hairline. The mantra
to invoke remembrance of the twelve names of the Lord
that are to be chanted while applying the tilaka is as
follows:

lalāṭe keśavaṁ dhyāyen



nārāyaṇam athodare




vakṣaḥ-sthale mādhavaṁ tu



govindaṁ kaṇṭha-kūpake




viṣṇuṁ ca dakṣiṇe kukṣau



bāhau ca madhusūdaam




                            32
Arcana-dipika.txt                               5/5/2017



trivikramaṁ kandhare tu



vāmanaṁ vāma-pārśvake




śrīdharaṁ vāma-bāhau tu



hṛṣīkeśaṁ ca kandhare




pṛṣṭhe tu padmanābhaṁ ca



kaṭyāṁ dāmodaraṁ nyaset




tat prakṣālana-toyaṁ tu



vāsudevāya mūrdhani




When one marks the forehead with tilaka, he must
remember Keśava. When one marks the lower abdomen, he
must remember Nārāyaṇa. For the chest, one should
remember Mādhava, and when marking the hollow of the
neck one should remember Govinda. Viṣṇu should be
remembered while marking the right side of the belly,
and Madhusūdana should be remembered when marking the
right arm. Trivikrama should be remembered when marking
the right shoulder, and Vāmana should be remembered when
marking the right side of the belly. Śrīdhara should be
remembered while marking the left arm, and Hṛṣīkeśa
should be remembered when marking the left shoulder.
Padmanābha and Dāmodara should be remembered when
marking the back. Vāsudeva should be remembered when
marking the top of the head.



In accordance with the above ślokas, chant the following
mantras while touching the different parts of the body:
[vii]7


                           33
Arcana-dipika.txt                                5/5/2017

on the forehead – oṁ keśavāya namaḥ

on the belly – oṁ nārāyaṇāya namaḥ

on the chest – oṁ mādhavāya namaḥ

on the hollow of the neck – oṁ govindāya namaḥ

on the right side of the abdomen – oṁ viṣṇave namaḥ

on the right arm – oṁ madhusūdanāya namaḥ

on the right shoulder – oṁ trivikramāya namaḥ

on the left side of the abdomen – oṁ vāmanāya namaḥ

on the left arm – oṁ śrīdharāya namaḥ

on the left shoulder – oṁ hṛṣīkeśāya namaḥ

on the upper back – oṁ padmanābhāya namaḥ

on the lower back – oṁ dāmodarāya namaḥ

Finally, after purifying the hand, the remaining water,
mixed with gopī-candana, should be wiped upon the top of
the head while chanting oṁ vāsudevāya namaḥ.

Ācamana

After applying tilaka, one should perform ācamana.
Vaiṣṇava ācamana is of two kinds: ordinary (sādhāraṇa)
and specific (viśeṣa). Before any devotional activity,
performing ordinary ācamana will suffice. However, at
the time of bathing the Deity or at the time of pūjā,
one must perform viśeṣa-ācamana.

Sādhāraṇa-ācamana: Men should wrap their brāhmaṇa
thread[viii]8 three times around the thumb of the right
hand. Taking in the left hand one ācamana spoon with
water in it, place a little water in the palm of the
right hand; and after chanting oṁ keśavāya namaḥ, sip a
little water[ix]9 and throw the rest to the side. After
purifying the hand with a new spoon of water, repeat the

Ṛg Veda Saṁhitā

                           35

Just as those with ordinary vision see the sun’s rays in
the sky, so the wise and learned devotees always see the
supreme abode of Lord Viṣṇu.

In a situation where one is unable to perform viśeṣa-
ācamana, ordinary ācamana will serve the purpose.

Chanting the mantras given by the guru (sandhyā-upāsanā)

After performing ācamana, one should chant the mantras
given by the guru. The period beginning forty-eight
minutes before sunrise until the sun is half-visible
above the horizon is the morning sandhyā, and the period
from sunset until the stars appear in the sky is the
evening sandhyā. Sandhyā should be performed facing east
in the morning and noon, and facing north in the
evening.[x]10

Awakening the Lord

Now one should enter the temple and, while remaining
outside the Deity room, ring the temple bell[xi]11 and
pray to the Lord to awaken by reciting either the śruti-
stava (Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 10.87.14-41) or the following
verses:

so ‘sāv adabhra-karuṇo bhagavān vivṛddha-

prema-smitena nayanāmburuhaṁ vijṛmbhan

utthāya viśva-vijayāya ca no viṣādaṁ

mādhvyā girāpanayatāt puruṣaḥ purāṇaḥ

Śrī Bhagavān, who is supreme and primeval, is
unlimitedly merciful. I pray that He will benedict me
with His smiling glance by opening His lotus eyes. He
can uplift the entire cosmic creation and remove our
grief and sorrow by the sweet words of instruction
emanating from His lotus mouth.

deva prapannārtti-hara prasādaṁ kuru keśava

avalokana-dānena bhūyo māṁ pārayācyuta

O Keśava, O infallible one, O remover of the distress of
the surrendered souls! Kindly bestow mercy upon me by
again awarding me Your transcendental glance.

jaya jaya kṛpāmaya jagatera nātha



sarva jagatere kara śubha dṛṣṭi-pāt



O Bhagavān! All glories, all glories unto You, the
merciful Lord of the universe! Please cast Your
auspicious glance upon all the worlds.

Upon reciting these prayers, clap three times and enter
the Deity room. Afterward, light the oil lamp[xii]12 and

                           36
Arcana-dipika.txt                               5/5/2017

sit down on the āsana. Perform ordinary ācamana and,
while ringing the bell, proceed to the place where śrī-
gurudeva is resting. Awaken him by touching his feet and
chanting:

uttiṣṭhottiṣṭha śrī guro




tyaja nidrāṁ kṛpāmaya




O most merciful gurudeva, please arise, please arise and
give up your sleep.

Then, touching the feet of Śrī Gaurāṅga-deva, awaken Him
while chanting:

uttiṣṭhottiṣṭha gaurāṅga




jahi nidrāṁ mahāprabho




śubha-dṛṣṭi pradānena




trailokya-maṅgalaṁ kuru




O Gaurāṅga Mahāprabhu, please arise, please arise and
give up Your sleep. Please benedict the three worlds
with Your auspicious glance.

Next, while touching the lotus feet of Śrī Śrī Rādhā-
Govinda, awaken Them by chanting:[xiii]13

go-gopa-gokulānanda

yaśodānanda vardhana




uttiṣṭha rādhayā sārddhaṁ


                            37
Arcana-dipika.txt                               5/5/2017

prātar āsīj jagat-pate




O joy of Gokula, the cowherd boys, and the cows! O
increaser of Mother Yaśodā’s bliss! O Lord of the
universe! Please arise along with Śrī Rādhā, for it is
almost morning.

Afterward, meditate that these personalities have risen
and taken their seat on the altar. Physically place the
Deities on the altar if they were removed to a separate
bed the previous night.

Washing the mouth (mukha-prakṣālana)

Now, by the mantras mentioned below, one should give
ācamana[xiv]14, a twig for cleaning the teeth (danta-
kāṣṭha), and again ācamana. (If these items are not
available, then one can offer them mentally by offering
water from the pañca-pātra into the throw-out pot[xv]15.
For Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, water has to be offered twice –
once for Rādhā and once for Kṛṣṇa.)

Offer the guru and Deities ācamana to rinse their mouths
while reciting the following mantras:

idaṁ ācamanīyaṁ aiṁ gurave namaḥ – offer ācamana into
the throw-out pot

idaṁ ācamanīyaṁ klīṁ gaurāya namaḥ – offer ācamana into
the throw-out pot

idaṁ ācamanīyaṁ śrīṁ klīṁ rādhā-kṛṣṇābhyāṁ namaḥ – offer
ācamana into the throw-out pot

Offer danta-kāṣṭha by placing a twig on a small tray in
front of the Lord while reciting the following mantras:

eṣa danta-kāṣṭhaḥ aiṁ gurave namaḥ

eṣa danta-kāṣṭhaḥ klīṁ gaurāya namaḥ

eṣa danta-kāṣṭhaḥ śrīṁ klīṁ rādhā-kṛṣṇābhyāṁ namaḥ

Now offer ācamana again while reciting the following
mantras:

idaṁ ācamanīyaṁ aiṁ gurave namaḥ – offer ācamana into
the throw-out pot twelve times

idaṁ ācamanīyaṁ klīṁ gaurāya namaḥ – offer ācamana into
the throw-out pot twelve times

idaṁ ācamanīyaṁ śrīṁ klīṁ rādhā-kṛṣṇābhyāṁ namaḥ – offer
ācamana into the throw-out pot twelve times

Cleaning procedures (nirmālyāpasāraṇa)

Then wipe the face, hands and feet of each Deity with
clean cloths[xvi]16. Clean the altar by removing old
garlands, tulasī leaves, and flowers. Afterward, purify

                           38
Arcana-dipika.txt                               5/5/2017

the hands with water from the pañca-pātra and offer one
tulasī leaf at the feet of each Deity,[xvii]17 while
chanting Their appropriate mūla-mantra. For example, to
offer to Śrī Gauraṅga, say: etat tulasī-pātram klīṁ
gaurāya svāhā. Decorate each Deity with the appropriate
crown, flute, ornaments, and so on, and then perform
maṅgala-ārati.

Procedure of maṅgala-ārati

Sitting on an āsana and ringing the bell, offer flowers
(puṣpāñjali) to the feet of each Deity and chant Their
respective mūla-mantras. Offer flowers first to śrī-
guru, Gaurāṅga, and then to Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. For example, to
offer flowers to śrī-gurudeva, chant, eṣaḥ puṣpāñjali
aiṁ gurave namaḥ. Still ringing the bell, the pūjārī
should open the doors or screen of the Deity room.

Afterward, offer the articles in the following order:
incense (dhūpa), ghee lamp (dīpa), conch with water
(śaṅkha), cloth (vastra), flowers (puṣpa), whisk
(cāmara) and peacock fan (paṅkha). Each article should
be offered while chanting the mūla-mantra for each
Deity.[xviii]18 For example, to offer incense to Śrī
Gaurāṅga chant, eṣa dhūpa klīṁ gaurāya svāhā. Before
each article is offered, purify the right hand with a
little water from the pañca-pātra, and then purify the
article once with a drop of water.

The peacock fan should only be offered to Kṛṣṇa.[xix]19
The cāmara and the peacock fan should not be used from
the beginning of the month of Kārttika until the day of
Śiva-rātri, unless the climate is hot, in which case
they can be used.

To perform madhyāhna-ārati with camphor is superb. First
of all, one should light the incense and the lamp and
offer the presented articles in sequence. One should
offer the five-wick lamp (pañca-pradīpa) four times to
the lotus feet, twice to the navel, one time to the
face, and seven times to all the limbs of the body
(e.g., a circle is made around the body of the Deity
seven times). The water in the conchshell should be
rotated three times over the heads of the Deities. For
offering the other articles there are no fixed rules
regarding the number of times they have to be rotated.
The incense holder should not be lifted above the Lord’s
navel. Flowers should be offered by rotating them around
the feet only. The offered or prasādī lamp should be
rotated as an offering to tulasī, Garuḍa, the demigods,
and the devotees.[xx]20

After completing the ārati, one should come out of the
Deity room, blow the conch three times (each blow for a
long period), and then rinse it in an appropriate place.
[xxi]21

Sprinkle the assembled devotees with the water remaining
from the offering in the small conchshell. After
chanting the jaya-dhvani of Śrī Guru-Gaurāṅga-Rādhā-
Vinodabihārījī and others, the pūjārī should offer
prostrated obeisances (sāṣṭāṇga daṇḍavat-praṇāma)
[xxii]22 four times. With full faith, the assembled
devotees should observe the ārati being performed, and

                             39
Arcana-dipika.txt                               5/5/2017

sing the ārati-kīrtana as well as the pañca-tattva
mantra and mahā-mantra with sweet voices, accompanied by
instruments such as mṛdanga, karatāla, gong, etc. The
pūjārī should finish the worship in time with the ārati-
kirtana. After the ārati, the assembled devotees should
perform circumbulation of the temple and tulasī four
times.

Offering foodstuffs after maṅgala-ārati (bālya-bhoga)

The procedure for the morning offering (bālya-bhoga),
forenoon offering (madhyāhna-bhoga), afternoon offering
(aparāhna-bhoga), and evening offering (rātri-kālīna-
bhoga) is the same. Madhyāhna-bhoga offering and ārati
should be completed by noon. Śrī Kṛṣṇa or Śrī Rādhā-
Kṛṣṇa, Śrī Gaurāṅga, and śrī-gurudeva’s offerings should
be made on individual, separate plates. If it is not
possible to offer separate plates to each Deity, then
one can offer bhoga to all of them on a single plate. In
cases where the Deities have separate altars, it is
obligatory to use separate plates for offering.

Next, one should bring in the bhoga to be offered and
set it in front of the altar. One should offer the bhoga
with a feeling that śrī-gurudeva himself is offering the
bhoga to Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa or Śrīman Mahāprabhu.[xxiii]23

Ringing the bell, one should chant:

eṣaḥ puṣpāñjaliḥ śrīṁ klīṁ rādhā-kṛṣṇābhyāṁ namaḥ –
offer puṣpāñjali, a few flower petals, at the lotus feet
of each Deity

idaṁ āsanaṁ śrīṁ klīṁ rādhā-kṛṣṇābhyāṁ namaḥ – offer the
āsana by putting a few flower petals on each sitting
place (If there is no āsana, then offer flowers on the
ground in front of the Deity, or in absence, offer water
into the throw-out pot.)

etat pādyaṁ śrīṁ klīṁ rādhā-kṛṣṇābhyāṁ namaḥ – offer
water into the throw-out pot

idaṁ ācamanīyaṁ śrīṁ klīṁ rādhā-kṛṣṇābhyāṁ namaḥ – offer
water into the throw-out pot

idaṁ miṣṭānna-pānīyādikam śrīṁ klīṁ rādhā-kṛṣṇābhyāṁ
namaḥ – place a tulasī leaf on each preparation.
Sprinkle a few drops of water from the conchshell onto
each preparation.[xxiv]24

One can offer bhoga to the Deity by using the mūla-
mantra for each Deity, such as aiṁ gurave namaḥ for the
spiritual master, or klīṁ gaurāya svāvāḥ for Gaurāṅga.
One may offer to Śrī Śrī Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa together by the
mantra, śrīṁ klīṁ rādha-kṛṣṇabhyām namah, or one may
offer separately first to Śrī Kṛṣṇa with the mantra,
klīṁ kṛṣṇāya namah, and then offer His prasāda to
Śrīmatī Rādhikā with the mantra, śrīṁ rādhikāyai namaḥ.
One can then offer to śrī-gurudeva the prasāda of Śrī
Gaurāṅga, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, or Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. In this mood
one can also offer unoffered bhoga to him, and śrī-
gurudeva will honor the prasāda after offering it to his
worshipful Deity. In special cases, where there is a
separate altar for śrī-gurudeva, or at his samādhi-

                           40
Arcana-dipika.txt                                5/5/2017

mandira, there is no fault in offering the unoffered
bhoga to him in this mood. Keeping one’s right hand,
with the brāhmaṇa thread wrapped around the thumb three
times, covered by the left hand, above the bhoga plate,
one should chant the mūla-mantra or gopāla-mantra eight
times.[xxv]25 Closing the curtains, one should come out
of the Deity room, close the door, and chant the kāma-
gāyatrī and then the gaura-gāyatrī ten times, followed
by the pañca-tattva mantra and mahā-mantra, both ten
times.

Then wait for the Lord to eat (e.g., 10 to 15 minutes).
Again enter the Deity room and offer ācamana to the
Deity by chanting:

idaṁ ācamanīyaṁ śrīm klīṁ rādhā-kṛṣṇābhyāṁ namaḥ

Then offer tāmbūla, or in absence offer water into the
throw-out pot, while chanting:

idaṁ tāmbūlaṁ śrīṁ klīṁ rādhā-kṛṣṇābhyāṁ namaḥ

Then offer this prasāda to śrī-gurudeva and all the
sakhīs in the following sequence:

idaṁ mahā-prasādaṁ – aiṁ śrī gurave namaḥ

idaṁ mahā-prasādaṁ – oṁ sarva-sakhībhyo namaḥ

idaṁ mahā-prasādaṁ – oṁ paurṇamāsyai namaḥ

idaṁ mahā-prasādaṁ – oṁ tulasyai namaḥ

idaṁ mahā-prasādaṁ – oṁ sarva-vaiṣṇavebhyo namaḥ

idaṁ mahā-prasādaṁ – oṁ sarva-vaiṣṇavībhyo namaḥ

idaṁ mahā-prasādaṁ – oṁ sarva vrajavāsībhyo namaḥ

After offering the prasādaṁ to śrī-gurudeva and his
assosciates,[xxvi]26 one should go outside the Deity
room and chant the guru-mantra and guru-gāyatrī ten
times each, followed by the pañca-tattva mantra and
mahā-mantra both ten times. Then, clapping one’s hands,
one should re-enter the Deity room and wash his mouth in
the following manner by chanting:

idaṁ ācamanīyaṁ aiṁ gurave namaḥ

Then one can take the plate outside and wash the floor
where it was placed. Replace the Deities’ flute and
crowns, and re-open the door or curtains.

Cleaning the temple

After the bālya-bhoga offering, while singing the holy
names of the Lord in a mood of servitude, clean the
Deity room and temple, either with water or with pure
cowdung mixed with clay. Then clean the paraphernalia,
used in worshiping the Lord.

Picking flowers and tulasī leaves

One should pay obeisances unto Śrī Bhagavān, seek His

                           41
Arcana-dipika.txt                               5/5/2017

permission, and pick flowers, tulasī leaves, and
mañjarīs according to the proper rules. It is prohibited
to collect tulasī leaves without having bathed. The best
way to pick tulasī and flowers is after taking morning
bath. One can also pick flowers before bathing and
collect tulasī leaves after bathing, as there is no
probhition for picking flowers before one’s bath. In
case of emergency and one is unable to take bath, one
should put on fresh clothes, bathe by meditation
(mantra-snāna), and with pure consciousness pick flowers
and tulasī leaves. For the arcana of Śrī Bhagavān,
fragrant white flowers are the best. Dry, stale, split
or torn flowers, flowers which have fallen on the earth,
flowers infested with insects, flowers on which hair has
fallen, flowers which are in the budding stage,
unfragrant flowers, flowers having a pungent smell,
unsanctified flowers, flowers already smelt or offered,
and flowers grown in impure places like the crematorium,
are unfit for the worship of Śrī Bhagavān. In the
absence of flowers, one can offer flowers in meditation
and offer tulasī leaves or water. Flowers should not be
washed with water. Flowers should be sanctified for the
arcana of Śrī Bhagavān by sprinkling candana or Gaṅgā
water on them, while chanting the following mantra:

puṣpe puṣpe mahā-puṣpe

supuṣpe puṣpa-sambhave




puṣpa-cayāvakīrṇe ca

huṁ phaṭ svāhā




O flowers, O great and auspicious flowers who have
appeared from budding creepers, may you be purified.

Special considerations for tulasī

After one bathes oneself and silently recites[xxvii]27
the gāyatrī-mantras, one should bathe tulasī (by pouring
water on her earth), and offer obeisances while chanting
her snāna-mantra and praṇāma-mantra. One should not
bathe tulasī without bathing oneself beforehand. While
chanting the mantra for picking tulasī (cayana-mantra),
one should pick tulasī leaves or soft mañjarīs,
individually and very carefully, with the right hand so
that Tulasī-devī will not experience any kind of pain.
One should not cut tulasī with scissors or a knife, nor
pick tulasī wearing shoes. After picking leaves, recite
the prayers begging for forgiveness for having caused
any pain to her. For other people (non-Vaiṣṇavas),
picking tulasī is probhited on various days. For pure
Vaiṣṇavas though, picking tulasī is only probhited on
the day of dvādaśī. Picking tulasī at night time is also
prohibited. Rather, one may use unoffered tulasī leaves
that are dried or picked many days previously. It is

                           42
Arcana-dipika.txt                               5/5/2017

forbidden to put tulasī on the feet of śrī-gurudeva. One
may put tulasī into the hand of śrī-gurudeva. One should
pick tulasī leaves only with the intention of using them
in the service of Bhagavān, and no one else.

Mantra to be chanted while offering obeiscences to
tulasī (praṇāma-mantra)

vṛndāyai tulasī devyai

priyāyai keśavasya ca




kṛṣṇa-bhakti-prade devi!

satyavatyai namo namaḥ




I offer praṇāma time and again unto Tulasī-devī, also
known as Vṛndā and Satyavatī, who is very dear to Śrī
Kṛṣṇa, and who bestows kṛṣṇa-bhakti.

Mantra to be chanted while bathing tulasī (snāna-mantra)

oṁ govindavallabhāṁ devīṁ



bhakta-caitanya-kāriṇīṁ




snāpayāmi jagad-dhātrīṁ

kṛṣṇa-bhakti-pradāyinīm




O goddess, I am bathing you who are very dear to
Govinda, who gives life to the devotees, who are the
mother of the entire world, and who bestows kṛṣṇa-
bhakti.[xxviii]28

Mantra to be chanted while picking leaves from tulasī
(cayana-mantra)

oṁ tulasy amṛta-janmāsi

sadā tvaṁ keśava-priyā




                            43

keśavārthe cinomi tvāṁ

varadā bhava śobhane




O Tulasī, you manifested from nectar and you are very
dear to Śrī Keśava. Now I am collecting your leaves for
the service of Keśava. O bestower of benedictions; be
pleased with me.

Mantra to be chanted to beg forgiveness for any offenses
committed (aparādha-kṣamā-prārthanā-mantra)

cayanodbhava duḥkhaṁ ca

yad hṛdi tava vartate




tat kṣamasva jagan-mātaḥ

vṛndā-devi namo ‘stu te




O mother of the universe, please forgive me if I have
caused you any pain by picking your leaves. O Vṛndā-
devi, I offer my humble obeisances unto you.




Chapter Three

Forenoon Duties (Pūrvāhna-kṛtya)



On the order of śrī-gurudeva [Meditating that “I am
performing this worhip on the order of śrī-gurudeva and
under his guidance.”], chant Śrī Śrī Guru-Gaurāṅga Śrī
Śrī Rādhā Vinodabihārījī kī jaya, offer prostrated
obeisances, and enter into the room for Their worship.
Then, sanctify the āsana, or sitting place. Before
beginning, gather all necessary paraphernalia for
performing the arcana of the Lord.

Sanctifying the sitting place (āsana-śuddhi)

First, spread out the āsana, purify the hands, and
perform ordinary ācamana. Worship the āsana by chanting
oṁ āsana-mantrasya meru-pṛṣṭha-ṛṣiḥ, sutalaṁ chandaḥ
kūrmo devatā āsanopaveśane viniyogaḥ. Then chant oṁ
ādhāra-śaktaye namaḥ, oṁ anantāya namaḥ, oṁ kūrmāya
namaḥ. Afterward, touch the āsana and chant:


                           44
Arcana-dipika.txt                               5/5/2017

pṛthivī tvayā dhṛtā lokā



devi tvaṁ viṣṇunā dhṛtā




tvaṁ ca dhāraya māṁ nityaṁ



pavitraṁ cāsanaṁ kuru




O Pṛthivī-devi (Mother Earth), you support all the
world’s people, and Śrī Viṣṇu sustains you. O goddess,
please always support me and sanctify this āsana.

Then sprinkle some water on the āsana, and offer the
āsana fragrant flowers.

Establishing the various paraphernalia for arcana

While sitting on one’s āsana and facing the Deities, one
should sit in the half-lotus sitting position (svastika-
āsana) or in the full-lotus sitting position (padma-
āsana). Then one should establish the pañca-pātra and
other paraphernalia for arcana in their respective
places on the floor in front of oneself. Establish the
bowl in which the Deity will be bathed (snāna-pātra) and
face the Deity. Keep the ācamana-pātra before the Deity.
In front and to the left of oneself, place: a bathing-
conchshell, which opens to the right (dakṣiṇa-śaṅkha),
on a three-legged stand; a bell on a small plate; pādya;
arghya; a small bowl for ācamanīya and madhuparka;
incense in a stand; and a small pot of water for
cleaning the blowing conch. Note: the blowing conchshell
should not be used in the Deity room. In front of
oneself to the right, in a line, one should place: the
conchshell; the pañca-pātra; a ghee lamp on a stand; a
container for candana (sandalwood paste); flowers and
tulasī leaves; and a throw-out pot, for throwing the
remnant water after purifying one’s hands and other
remnant articles, at an easily accessible distance (see
diagram).

Before establishing each article, draw two intersecting
triangles on the place where the article is to be
established, chanting the mantra, oṁ astrāya phaṭ. Then
rinse and place the article in its place.

After washing the tulasī leaves, place them in the
pātra. Flowers should not be washed with water. Purify
them by chanting the puṣpa-śuddhi-mantra.

puṣpe puṣpe mahā-puṣpe



                             45
Arcana-dipika.txt                               5/5/2017




supuṣpe puṣpa-sambhave




puṣpa-cayāvakīrṇe ca




huṁ phaṭ svāhā




O flowers, O great and auspicious flowers who have
appeared from budding creepers, may you be purified.

In the absence of Gaṅgā water, purify ordinary water by
chanting the previously mentioned mantra to invoke the
tīrthas.

gaṅge ca yamune caiva




godāvari sarasvati




narmade sindho kāveri




jale ‘smin sannidhiṁ kuru




O Gaṅgā, O Yamunā, O Godāvarī, O Sarasvatī, O Narmadā, O
Sindhu, O Kāverī, please become present in this water.

There is no need to recite this mantra if one has Gaṅgā
water.

Establishing water in the paÑca-pātra

First, one should establish the pañca-pātra. Pouring a
few drops of water from a waterpot on the floor, one
should use the water to draw two intersecting triangles
on the place where the pañca-pātra will sit. Then,

                            46
Arcana-dipika.txt                              5/5/2017

chanting the mantra, oṁ astrāya phaṭ, one should pour
some water from the waterpot into one’s hand and
sprinkle it on the pañca-pātra along with its spoon.

After washing the pañca-pātra in this way, one should
chant oṁ ādhāra-śaktaye namaḥ, and place the pañca-pātra
on the two intersecting triangles. Then with the mantra,
oṁ hṛdayāya namaḥ, one should place a flower petal in
the pañca-pātra. Now one should pour water into the
pañca-pātra, saying oṁ śirase svāhā. After this, with a
flower petal dipped in candana, one should perform
worship of the pañca-pātra by offering the flower petal,
in ārati fashion, to the pañca-pātra, chanting oṁ aṁ
arka-maṇḍalāya dvādaśa-kalātmane namaḥ. Then one should
press the flower petal onto the side of the pañca-pātra.
Then one should worship the water in the pañca-pātra by
offering a flower petal dipped in candana. At this time
one should chant oṁ uṁ soma-maṇḍalāya ṣoḍaśa-kalātmane
namaḥ. Then one should attach the flower to the rim of
the pañca-pātra. Afterward, invoke all of the tīrthas,
or holy places, to that water by chanting the mantra to
invoke the holy tīrthas (see previous page). Then one
should chant the mūla-mantra or gopāla-mantra over the
pañca-pātra eight times. While doing this, the sacred
thread should be wrapped around the thumb, and the left
hand should be covering the right hand so that the
chanting of the mantras on the fingers cannot be seen.

Establishing the conchshell

Next one should establish the bathing conchshell, in
front of and to the left of oneself. Pouring a few drops
of water from the waterpot on to the floor, one should
use the water to draw the same triangular design on the
place where the conchshell stand will sit. Chanting oṁ
astrāya phaṭ, one should pour some water from the
waterpot into his hand and sprinkle it on the conchshell
stand to wash it. After this, one should chant oṁ
ādhāra-śaktaye namaḥ, and taking one petal dipped in
candana, place it in the triangular design. Then one
should place the conchshell stand on the triangular
design. Again, chanting oṁ astrāya phaṭ, one should wash
the conchshell in the same way and place it on the
stand. While chanting oṁ hṛdayāya namaḥ, one should
place gandha (a mixture of candana, camphor, and musk)
[xxix]29, flowers, and tulasī leaves into the
conchshell. Chanting oṁ śirase svāhā, one should fill
the conchshell with water from the waterpot. Next,
taking a tulasī leaf and a flower petal dipped in
gandha, one should worship the conchshell stand by
offering the flower petal to the conchshell stand, in
ārati fashion, with the mantra, oṁ maṁ vahni-maṇḍalāya
daśa-kalātmane namaḥ. Then one should attach the flower
petal with candana and the tulasī leaf to the conchshell
stand. Next one should take another flower petal dipped
in candana and a tulasī leaf, and perform the worship of
the conchshell by offering them to the conchshell and
uttering the mantra, oṁ aṁ arka-maṇḍalāya dvādaśa-
kalātmane namaḥ. Then one should press the the flower
petal and tulasī leaf onto the outside of the
conchshell. After this, one should take another flower
petal dipped in candana and a tulasī leaf, and perform
the worship of the water in the conchshell by offering
them to the water while chanting the mantra, oṁ uṁ soma-

                              47
Arcana-dipika.txt                              5/5/2017

maṇḍalāya ṣoḍaśa-kalātmane namaḥ. One should put the
flower petal and tulasī leaf into the water inside the
conchshell. Summon all the holy waters into the water
inside the conchshell by chanting the tīrthāvāhana-
mantra, while using the aṅkuśa-mudrā (see diagram on
next page). Touch and cover the water in the conchshell
with the right hand, covered by the left hand, and chant
the mūla-mantra or gopāla-mantra eight times. One should
be careful not to touch the water with one’s fingernail.
[xxx]30 One should put a little water from the conch
into the proksaṇī-pātra (a pot meant for contaning this
special water called viśeṣa-arghya). Then pour a little
water from the conchshell into one’s right hand, and
sprinkle the water from the conchshell three times onto
the items and area of worship, and one’s body. Pour the
remaining water in the throw-out pot.[xxxi]31 Fill the
conch again with water while chanting oṁ śirase svāhā,
and place it in front of you. Now that the bathing
conchshell has been established, [meaning that it has
been purified and the presence of all the holy waters,
as well as the Lord, have been invoked into the
conchshell] one should chant the prayers to the
conchshell (saṅkha-stuti).

Prayers to the conchshell (saṅkha-stuti)

tvaṁ purā sāgarotpanno

viṣṇunā vidhṛtaḥ kare




mānitaḥ sarva-devaiś ca

pāñcajanya namo ‘stu te




O Pāñcajanya, please accept my praṇāma. In ancient
times, you were born from the ocean and seized by the
lotus hand of Lord Viṣṇu. Thus you are honoured by all
the demigods.

tava nādena jīmūtā

vitrasyanti surāsurāḥ




śaśāṅka-yuta-dīptābha

O Pāñcajanya, upon hearing your roaring sound, the

                           48
Arcana-dipika.txt                              5/5/2017

mountains, clouds, demigods and demons tremble in fear.
Your splendour equals that of thousands of brilliant
moons. I offer praṇāma unto you.

garbhā devāri-nārīṇāṁ

vilayante sahasradhā




tava nādena pātāle

pāñcajanya namo ‘stu te




O Pāñcajanya, I offer praṇāma unto you. Your roaring
sound shatters into thousands of pieces the wombs of the
demons’ wives in the lower planetary systems.

Glories of the conchshell (śaṅkha-māhātmya)

In a small bathing conchshell (which opens to the
right), place cow’s milk, paddy rice (ātapa), rice, and
flowers. In the absence of these items, regular water
can be used for bathing the śrī nārāyaṇa-śilā.[xxxii]32
Blowing a conchshell during the bathing is very pleasing
to Him. Bathing is best performed while reciting the
puruṣa-sūkta-mantra. Alternatively, chanting the mantra,
idaṁ snānīyodakaṁ oṁ namo nārāyaṇāya namaḥ, while
bathing the Deity, can serve the purpose. The water
contained in the conchshell is as good as Gaṅgā water.

Establishing the bell

In front of the blowing conch, a little further away
from oneself, one should establish the bell. Pouring a
few drops of water on the floor, one should use the
water to draw the triangular design on the place where
the bell will sit.

Then, chanting oṁ astrāya phaṭ, one should take some
water from the waterpot into the hand and sprinkle it on
the bell, which should be sitting on a small round brass
plate.

Then saying oṁ ādhāra-śaktaye namaḥ, one should place
the bell on the triangular design. Then, chanting oṁ
jaya-dhvani-mantra-mātre svāhā, one should offer, in
ārati fashion, a flower petal dipped in candana to the
bell. One should press the flower petal to the bell, and
then ring the bell. Now that the bell has been
established, [meaning that it has been purified and is
now ready to be engaged in the service of the Lord] one
should chant prayers glorifying the bell (ghaṇṭa-śuddhi-
mantra), meditating that the bell is a servant of the
Lord.

Glories of the bell (ghaṇṭa-śuddhi-mantra)

O beautiful bell, you embody the sweet sound of all
music and you are dear to the God of gods, Śrī Kṛṣṇa.
Without you there is no auspiciousness for anyone.

Offering incense (dhūpa-dāna-mantra)

Placing the incense in its appropriate place one should
offer it the following prayer,

vanaspati rasotpanno



gandhāḍhyo gandha uttamaḥ



āghreyaḥ sarva-devānāṁ



dhūpo ‘yaṁ pratigṛhyatām




O Bhagavān, this incense,   having been obtained from the
sap of the king of trees,   is endowed with the best of
fragrances. Please accept   this fragrant incense, which
is very sweet smelling to   the demigods.

Offering the ghee lamp (dīpa-dāna-mantra)

sva-prakāśo mahā-tejaḥ

sarvatas timirāpahaḥ




sa bāhyābhyantara-jyotir

dīpo ‘yaṁ pratigṛhyatām




                             50
Arcana-dipika.txt                              5/5/2017



O Bhagavān, this lamp is endowed with immense
effulgence. It removes all darkness and illuminates both
internally and externally. Please accept this lamp.

After reciting the above mantra, offer puṣpāñjali, or
flowers, to the lamp while chanting oṁ namaḥ
dhīpeśvarāya.

Offering water for foot bathing (pādya)

Pādya is water for washing the Lord’s lotus feet. The
ingredients used in pādya are dūrvā grass or kuśa grass,
śyāmā dhāna (grain), and tulasī leaves, or one can use
water in which some fragrant flowers have been soaked or
to which rose-water has been added. Candana can be also
added. Pādya is placed in the bowl called pādya-pātra,
and is offered to the Lord with a spoon, by pouring it
over His lotus feet. Only at the time of bathing does
one physically pour it over the Deities’ feet. At other
times one shows the spoon to the Lord and offers it by
meditation. Afterwards, one discharges it into the
throw-out pot.

Offering special sanctified water (arghya)

Arghya is an offering (a drink or a liquid for
sprinkling on the head) meant for highly respectable
persons upon greeting them. The ingredients of arghya
are water, milk, dūrvā grass, yoghurt, unboiled paddy
rice (aravā), rice, sesame seeds, white mustard seeds,
barley, etc. A brief version can be made using only
candana, flowers, and water. Lotus petals are very dear
to the Lord. For worship of śrī-viṣṇu-tattva, combine
tulasī leaves with the above mentioned items. It is
placed in a bowl called the arghya-pātra, and offered to
the Lord with a spoon. The spoon should be held before
the mouth of the Lord, while the pūjārī meditates that
he is offering it to the Lord for His satisfaction. One
should then discard the liquid by pouring it into the
throw-out pot (snāna-pātra).

Offering foodstuffs (madhuparka)

Madhuparka is foodstuff or drink. Madhuparka contains
ghee, honey, and sugar. According to some, the
combination of yoghurt and milk, along with the above
three items, is also known as madhuparka. The madhuparka
should be placed in a bowl called a madhuparka-pātra,
and offered to the Lord with a spoon. The spoon should
be held before the mouth of the Lord, while the pūjārī
meditates that he is offering it to the Lord for His
satisfaction. The liquid is then poured into the bathing
receptacle, called the throw-out pot (snāna-pātra).

Offering water for mouth rinsing (ācamanīya)

Ācamanīya is water used for rinsing the Lord’s mouth. It
consists of water with ground nutmeg, ground cloves, and
kakolā-berry scent. It is placed in a bowl called the
ācamanīya-pātra, and offered to the Lord with a spoon.
The spoon should be held before the mouth of the Lord
while the pūjārī meditates that he is offering water to

                           51
Arcana-dipika.txt                                 5/5/2017

the Lord for rinsing His mouth. The water is then
discarded into the throw-out pot. This is done three
times. Often the pūjārī simply uses water from the
pañca-pātra.

Offering five nectarean ingredients (paÑcāmṛta)

Pañcāmṛta consists of yoghurt, milk, ghee, honey, and
sugar. In the absence of ghee, one can use fused rice
(lāja). In the absence of honey, one can use jaggery. In
the absence of yoghurt, one can use milk. In the absence
of any such items, one should meditate on the particular
item and offer a flower or a tulasī leaf. In the absence
of even flowers or a tulasī leaf, when there is nothing
available, one can compensate by using regular water to
perform the worship. Above each bowl of one of the
ingredients of the pañcāmṛta, one should chant the mūla-
mantra eight times, with the hand gesture known as the
cakra-mudrā to protect it. Before bathing the Deities
with pañcāmṛta, purify the articles by chanting the
pañcāmṛta-śodhana-mantras.

Mantras to sanctify the ingredients (paÑcāmṛta-śodhana
mantras)

For bathing the Deity or śrī-śālagrāma-śilā with
pañcāmṛta on Śrī Janmāṣṭamī, Śrī Phālgunī-pūrṇimā or Śrī
Gaura-pūrṇimā, and other special occasions, each
ingredient of the pañcāmṛta should be sanctified by the
following pañcāmṛta-śodhana mantras.

for milk, chant oṁ payaḥ pṛthivyāṁ paya auṣadhīṣu payo
dīvyantarīkṣe payodhā payasvatī pradiśaḥ santu mahyam

for yoghurt, chant oṁ dadhi krāvno akāriṣaṁ jiṣṇor
aśvasy vājinaḥ surabhino mukhākarat prāṇa āyuṁṣita riṣat

for ghee, chant oṁ ghṛtaṁ ghṛtapāvānaḥ pibata vasāṁ vasā
pāvānaḥ pivatāntarikṣasya havir asi svāhā diśaḥ pradiśa
ādiśo vidiśa uddiśo digbhyaḥ svāhā

for sugar, chant oṁ apāṁ rasaṁ udvayasaṁ sūrye santaṁ
samāhitaṁ apāṁ rasasya yo rasas tam vo gṛhṇāmy
uttamopayāma gṛhītosīndrāya juṣṭaṁ gṛhṇāmy eṣa te yonir
indrāya te juṣṭatamam

for honey, chant oṁ madhu bātā ṛtāyate madhu kṣaranti
sindhavaḥ mādhvīrnaḥ santv oṣadhīḥ madhu-naktam utoṣaso
madhumat pārthivaṁ rajaḥ madhu dyaur astu naḥ pitā
madhumān no vanaspatiḥ madhumān astu sūryaḥ mādhvīr gāvo
bhavantu naḥ - oṁ madhu oṁ madhu oṁ madhu

Mantras to be chanted while bathing with paÑcāmṛta

The ingredients may then be mixed together, or offered
separately, while chanting the appropriate mantras. A
tulasī leaf should be placed in each item beforehand.
The mantras for offering each item while bathing are as
follows:

milk: oṁ idaṁ dugdhaṁ snānīyam (or oṁ idaṁ kṣīra
snāniyam)

yogurt: oṁ idaṁ dadhi snānīyam

                           52
Arcana-dipika.txt                               5/5/2017


ghee: oṁ idaṁ ghṛta snānīyam

honey: oṁ idaṁ madhu snānīyam

sugar: oṁ idaṁ śita snānīyam (or oṁ idaṁ śarkarā
snānīyam)

For example, while bathing Gaurāṅga with milk from the
conch shell, one should chant oṁ idaṁ dugdhaṁ snānīyam
klīṁ gaurāya svāhā. One may use these mantras for
bathing śrī-gurudeva as well, such as on his vyāsa-pūjā.

Scent (gandha)

The three items candana (sandalwood), karpūra (camphor),
and aguru (scented aguru wood), mixed in a particular
ratio, comprise gandha.

The articles to be offered (upacāra)

According to time and place, sixteen, twelve, ten or
five articles (upacāra) can be employed in the worship
of Śrī Bhagavān. Before the performance of the pūjā, one
should determine the number of items to be offered,
collect them, and bringing them all inside the Deity
room. One may offer the following combinations according
to one’s means or the time available.

If any item is unable to be procured, then they can be
substituted by meditation and the offering of ācamana
from the pañca-pātra.

sixteen articles (soḍaśopacāra) – The sixteen items for
offering are: āsana (seat), svāgata (welcoming), pādya
(ingredients for foot-bathing), arghya (a ritualistic
liquid offered to honourable persons), ācamanīya
(ingredients for washing the mouth), madhuparka (a sweet
drink), snāna (ingredients for bathing), vastra
(clothes), upavīta (sacred thread), bhūṣaṇa (ornaments),
gandha (a special scent), puṣpa (flowers), dhūpa
(incense), dīpa (ghee lamp), naivedya (foodstuffs),
mālya (garland), and vandanā (prayers).

twelve articles (dvādaśopacāra) – The twelve items for
offering are: āsana, pādya, arghya, ācamanīya,
madhuparka, snāna, vastra, gandha, puṣpa, dhūpa, dīpa,
and naivedya.

ten articles (daśopacāra) – The ten items for offering
are: āsana, pādya, arghya, ācamanīya, madhuparka,
gandha, puṣpa, dhūpa, dīpa, and naivedya.

five articles (pañcopacāra) – The five items for
offering are gandha, puṣpa, dhūpa, dīpa, and naivedya.

Purification of oneself (bhūta-śuddhi)

Before pūjā, one should purify oneself by thinking in
the following way: “By constitution I am an eternal
servant of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, but by some misfortune I became
averse to Him since time immemorial. Thus identifying
myself with a material body in this illusory existence,
and being trapped in this repeated cycle of birth and

                           53
Arcana-dipika.txt                              5/5/2017

death, I was burning in the blazing fire of the
threefold miseries. However, by great fortune – that is,
by the mercy of śrī-guru – I have come to understand my
identity as a minute, atomic spiritual particle, an
eternal servant of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, completely aloof from the
gross and subtle bodies. Now, by the order of śrī-
gurudeva, under his shelter, I have obtained the fortune
of serving Śrī Śrī Guru-Gaurāṅga and Śrī Śrī Rādhā-
Vinodabihārījī.” With such feelings in the heart, recite
the following mantra and meditate within:

nāhaṁ vipro na ca nara-patir nāpi vaiśyo na śūdro

nāhaṁ varṇī na ca gṛha-patir no vanastho yatir vā

kintu prodyan nikhila-paramānanda-pūrṇāmṛtābdher

gopī-bhartuḥ pada-kamalayor dāsa-dāsānudāsaḥ

I am not a brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya or śūdra, nor a
brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha or sannyāsī. Being
transcendental to this gross and subtle body, I am the
servant of the servant of the servant of the lotus feet
of the master of the gopīs, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who is the
ultimate shelter of everyone, full of transcendental
bliss, and an ocean of unlimited nectar.

Meditation on oneself (ātma-dhyāna-mantra)

divyaṁ śrī-hari-mandirāḍhya-



tilakaṁ kaṇṭhaṁ sumālānvitaṁ



vakṣaḥ śrī-harināma-varṇa-subhagaṁ

I meditate on myself as being surrendered at the lotus
feet of śrī-guru and possessing great determination to
serve him. I meditate on myself being adorned with

Arcana-dipika.txt                                 5/5/2017

beautiful tilaka, representing the temple of Śrī Hari,
on my forehead. I am wearing a beautiful necklace of
tulasī beads around my neck. My chest is marked with the
holy name and anointed with sandalwood pulp. I am
dressed in fine and pure cloth, and within I am
constantly absorbed in ever-fresh spiritual sentiments.




Chapter Four

Śrī Guru-pūjā



Śrī Gaurasundara is sitting on a jewel-studded altar at
the Yogapīṭha in Māyāpura, which is part of the
transcendental realm of Śrī Navadvīpa-dhāma. Śrī
Nityānanda Prabhu is standing at His right side, Śrī
Gadādhara at His left, Śrī Advaita Prabhu is standing
before Him with folded hands, and Śrīnivāsa Paṇḍita is
standing behind Him, holding an umbrella. Just below the
jewelled altar of Śrī Gaurasundara there is another
altar, on which śrī-gurudeva is sitting.

Keeping this conception within the heart, one should
worship śrī-gurudeva, according to one’s capacity, with
sixteen, twelve, ten, or five articles.

Obeisances unto Śrī Guru-varga

Offer praṇāma unto the guru-paramparā, situated on the
altar to the left side of the Deity. Then recite:

aiṁ gurave namaḥ

aiṁ parama-gurave namaḥ

aiṁ parameṣṭhi gurave namaḥ

aiṁ śrī guru-paramparāyai namaḥ

oṁ sarva-gurūttamāya śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanyāya namaḥ

Mantra to meditate on Śrī Gurudeva

prātaḥ śrīman navadvīpe dvi-netraṁ dvi-bhujaṁ gurum

varābhaya-pradaṁ śāntaṁ smaret tan nāma-pūrvakam

In the early morning, chant śrī-gurudeva’s name, while
remembering him as being situated in Śrī Navadvīpa or
Śrī Vṛndāvana-dhāma, and possessing two eyes and two
arms. He is the bestower of fearlessness and the
embodiment of peacefulness.

Arcana of Śrī Gurudeva

After reciting this mantra, utter the name of one’s śrī-
gurudeva and chant his jaya-dhvani three times. For
example, nitya-līlā-praviṣṭa oṁ viṣṇupāda aṣṭottara-śata
Śrī Śrīmad Bhakti Prajñāna Keśava Gosvāmī Mahārāja kī

                              55
Arcana-dipika.txt                               5/5/2017

jaya!

First worship śrī-gurudeva mentally,[xxxiii]33 and pray
to him for his mercy. Then worship him with external
items, while reciting the guru-mantra, received at the
time of dīkṣā. Next, call upon śrī-gurudeva with the
feeling, “I am bathing him in the snāna-pātra.” While
ringing the bell, one should chant the following mantras
and offer him an āsana, pādya, etc.

idaṁ āsanaṁ aiṁ gurave namaḥ – offer flowers dipped in
candana into the snāna-pātra for the purpose of making
an āsana for śrī-gurudeva

prabho! kṛpayā svāgataṁ kuru aiṁ gurave namaḥ – with
folded hands, invite him on the āsana situated in the
snāna-pātra

etat pādyaṁ aiṁ gurave namaḥ – offer water at his lotus
feet into the snāna-pātra

idaṁ arghyaṁ aiṁ gurave namaḥ – offer arghya (gandha,
flowers, and water) into the snāna-pātra

idaṁ ācamanīyaṁ aiṁ gurave namaḥ – discharge water into
the throw-out pot

eṣaḥ madhuparkaḥ aiṁ gurave namaḥ – offer madhuparka
into the snāna-pātra

idaṁ ācamanīyaṁ aiṁ gurave namaḥ – discharge water into
the throw-out pot

idaṁ sugandha tailaṁ aiṁ gurave namaḥ – afterward,
meditate on applying fragrant oil to the beautiful limbs
of śrī-gurudeva, and offer a flower dipped in candana
into the snāna-pātra

idaṁ snānīyaṁ aiṁ gurave namaḥ – while ringing the bell
and reciting prayers, bathe śrī-gurudeva in the snāna-
pātra with fragrant water poured from the conchshell

idaṁ sottarīya-vastraṁ aiṁ gurave namaḥ – offer two
flowers in the throw-out pot for the purpose of offering
an upper and lower garment to śrī-gurudeva

idaṁ ācamanīyaṁ aiṁ gurave namaḥ – discharge water into
the throw-out pot

After this, meditate that śrī-gurudeva is sitting at his
place on the altar. Touch his feet, and chant the guru-
mantra eight times. This is called prasādhana [meaning
that one has now completed cleansing and decorating the
transcendental body of śrī-gurudeva.] Then offer the
following articles. In absence, meditate on offering the
article, and offer a flower dipped in candana at his
lotus feet, or offer water into the throw-out pot.

idaṁ upavītaṁ aiṁ gurave namaḥ – offer the sacred thread
(upavīta) to śrī-gurudeva

idaṁ tilakaṁ aiṁ gurave namaḥ – draw the tilaka mark on
the body of śrī-gurudeva


                           56
Arcana-dipika.txt                               5/5/2017

idaṁ ābharaṇaṁ aiṁ gurave namaḥ – for the purpose of
decorating śrī-gurudeva [with a flower garland, brāhmaṇa
thread, cloth, tilaka etc.], offer a flower dipped in
candana at his lotus feet

eṣa gandhaḥ aiṁ gurave namaḥ – offer scent at the lotus
feet of śrī-gurudeva

idaṁ sugandhaṁ puṣpaṁ aiṁ gurave namaḥ – offer flowers
dipped in candana at his lotus feet

etat tulasī pātraṁ aiṁ gurave namaḥ – offer tulasī into
his right hand

eṣaḥ dhūpa aiṁ gurave namaḥ – offer incense to him by
discharging water into the throw-out pot

eṣaḥ dīpa aiṁ gurave namaḥ – offer a ghee lamp to him by
discharging water into the throw-out pot[xxxiv]34

[If one is performing guru-pūjā as part of regular
arcana, then foodstuff (naivedyaṁ) will be offered
during the arcana of Śrī Gaurāṅga and Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa,
and the remnants will be offered to śrī-gurudeva
afterward. If this is the case, one continues directly
to śrī-gaurāṅga-pūjā and the arcana of Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa.

In the case where arcana is only being performed to śrī-
gurudeva, or being performed separately such as on his
vyāsa-pūjā or disappearance day, one should continue the
arcana of śrī-gurudeva and offer him naivedya as shown
below. (śrī-gurudeva will offer the bhoga himself to his
worshipful Deity, and then honor the remnants.)]

Here one should again offer āsana, pādya, and ācamana as
before; and then offer foodstuffs (naivedyaṁ) by
chanting:

idaṁ naivedyaṁ aiṁ gurave namaḥ – place tulasī leaves on
each preparation and sprinkle the offering plate
(naivedya-pātra) with water from the conchshell

idaṁ pānīyaṁ aiṁ gurave namaḥ – place a tulasī leaf and
sprinkle a drop of water from the conchshell into the
drinking cup (pānīya-pātra) from the conchshell[xxxv]35

idaṁ ācamanīyaṁ aiṁ gurave namaḥ – discharge water into
the throw-out pot

After this, meditate that śrī-gurudeva is very happily
situated on his altar.

idaṁ tāmbūlaṁ aiṁ gurave namaḥ – offer him tāmbūla, or
in the absence of tāmbūla, offer flowers

idaṁ mālyaṁ aiṁ gurave namaḥ – offer him a flower
garland

idaṁ sarvam aiṁ gurave namaḥ – offer a flower unto the
lotus feet of śrī-gurudeva, representing all the items
that are very dear to śrī-gurudeva that may have not
been offered

After this, chant guru-gāyatrī ten times and offer

prayers and obeisances unto him.

O Gurudeva! You are immersed in an ocean of bliss and
you can award transcendental service. You are the
beloved gopīkā of Śrīmatī Rādhikā. Please bestow on me
the shelter of your lotus feet, so that I can be
blissfully engaged in the transcendental service of the
Queen of Vraja, Śrīmatī Rādhārānī.

Obeisances unto Śrī Gurudeva

darkness of ignorance, with the torchlight of knowledge.

O spiritual master, I continually offer my obeisances
unto you, who are always in the presence of Srīmatī
Rādhārāṇī and very much devoted to Her. You always
reside in the association of Her confidantes, the gopīs,
and you are the abode of loving devotion to Śrī Mādhava.

I bow down to the beautiful lotus feet of my spiritual
master, by whose causeless mercy I have obtained the
supreme holy name, the divine mantra; the service of the
son of Sacī-mātā; the association of Śrīla Svarūpa
Dāmodara, Rūpa Gosvāmī, and his older brother, Sanātana
Gosvāmī; the supreme abode of Mathurā; the blissful
abode of Vṛndāvana; the divine Rādhā-kuṇḍa and
Govardhana Hill; and the desire within my heart for the
loving service of Śrī Rādhikā and Mādhava in Vṛndāvana.

Chapter Five

Śrī Gaurāṅga-pūjā



[One may perform worship of Śrī Gaurāṅga with the same
paraphernalia used in the arcana of śrī-gurudeva, but
the paraphernalia should be purified first with water
from the pañca-pātra. Already offered items, such as
incense, ghee lamp, etc., cannot be used. Also separate
bathing pots are used for the Deity and for śrī-
gurudeva.]

Beg śrī-gurudeva for the mercy to perform the arcana of
Śrī Gaurāṅga in His pañca-tattva form. First meditate on
Śrī Navadvīpa-dhāma.

Meditation on Śrī Navadvīpa-dhāma

All glories to Śrī Navadvīpa-dhāma, situated on the
beautiful banks of Śrī Bhāgīrathī, which is spread wide
in the shape of a tortoise shell and adorned with
jewelled palaces of gold and numerous charming resting
places. That place where the devotees are submerged in
the inner moods of śrī-kṛṣṇa saṅkīrtana-rasa, being non-
different from Śrī Vṛndāvana-dhāma, is supremely
matchless within all the three worlds.

Then meditate on the lotus feet of Śrīman Mahāprabhu, as
He sits on a jewelled altar at Yogapīṭha Māyāpura,
within the boundary of Śrī Navadvīpa-dhāma.

nṛtyāveśa-rasānumoda-madhuraṁ kandarpa-veśojjvalaṁ

caitanyaṁ kanaka-dyutiṁ nija-janaiḥ saṁsevyamānaṁ bhaje

I worship Śrī Caitanyadeva, whose hair is intertwined
with beautiful garlands of pearls, whose face is
splendorous like a radiant moon, whose limbs are
anointed with candana and aguru, and who, adorned with
wonderful clothes, garlands, and transcendental,
glittering ornaments, dances while absorbed in the
ecstasies of sweet mellows. His body of golden
complexion, being adorned with the ornaments of bhāva,
makes Him appear like an enchanting Cupid amidst the
presence of His intimate associates.

Arcana of Śrī Gaurāṅga

In the same manner as that of guru-pūjā, after first
performing mānasa-pūjā, or mental worship, of Śrī
Gaurāṅga, one should, with paraphernalia, perform the
external worship of Śrī Gaurāṅga in the form of the
Deity or śrī-śālagrāma-śilā, while chanting the śrī-
gaura-mantra which one has received from

śrī-gurudeva.[xxxvi]36 One should meditate that, “After
invoking Śrī Gaurāṅga-deva, I am bathing Him,” and offer
the following articles by chanting:

idaṁ āsanaṁ klīṁ gaurāya svāhā – offer a flower with
candana into the bathing pot (snāna-pātra) for the
purpose of an āsana

prabho! kṛpayā svāgataṁ kuru klīṁ gaurāya svāhā – with
folded hands, invite Śrīman Mahāprabhu onto the āsana
situated in the snāna-pātra

etat pādyaṁ klīṁ gaurāya svāhā – offer water at His
lotus feet in the snāna-pātra

idaṁ arghyaṁ klīṁ gaurāya svāhā – offer arghya into the
snāna-pātra

idaṁ ācamanīyaṁ klīṁ gaurāya svāhā – discharge water
into the throw-out pot

eṣa madhuparkaḥ klīṁ gaurāya svāhā – offer madhuparka
into the snāna-pātra

idaṁ ācamanīyaṁ klīṁ gaurāya svāhā – discharge water
into the throw-out pot

idaṁ sugandha tailaṁ klīṁ gaurāya svāhā – afterward,
meditate on applying oil to the limbs of Śrīman
Mahāprabhu and offer a flower dipped in candana into the
snāna-pātra

idaṁ snānīyaṁ klīṁ gaurāya svāhā – bathe Him with

                              60
Arcana-dipika.txt                               5/5/2017

fragrant water from the conchshell while ringing the
bell and reciting prayers; after bathing Him, dry His
body with a soft cloth

idaṁ sottarīya-vastraṁ klīṁ gaurāya svāhā – offer two
flowers into the throw-out pot, meditating upon offering
garments to Him

idaṁ ācamanīyaṁ klīṁ gaurāya svāhā – offer water into
the throw-out pot

Meditate on Śrīman Mahāprabhu, sitting on His altar and
feeling very satisfied. Then touch His lotus feet and
chant śrī-gaura-mantra eight times. Afterward, chant:

idaṁ upavītaṁ klīṁ gaurāya svāhā – offer the sacred
thread to Śrī Gaurasundara, or in its absence offer a
flower

idaṁ tilakaṁ klīṁ gaurāya svāhā – draw tilaka marks on
the Deity. In absence of tilaka, meditate on drawing
tilaka marks on the Deity and offer a flower dipped in
candana.

idaṁ ābharaṇaṁ klīṁ gaurāya svāhā – meditate on
decorating the Deity with ornaments and offer a flower

eṣa gandha klīṁ gaurāya svāhā – offer scent at the lotus
feet of the Deity

idaṁ sugandhaṁ puṣpaṁ klīṁ gaurāya svāhā – offer flowers
dipped in candana at the lotus feet of the Deity

etat tulasī-pātram klīṁ gaurāya svāhā – offer tulasī
leaves dipped in candana at His lotus feet

eṣa dhūpa klīṁ gaurāya svāhā – offer water into the
throw-out pot

eṣa dīpa klīṁ gaurāya svāhā – offer water into the
throw-out pot

[If one only has a single bhoga offering plate and one
is worshiping Śrī Gaurāṅga and Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, it
should be then offered during the time of Śrī Rādhā-
Kṛṣṇa arcana. Here, one can substitute the bhoga by
discharging water into the throw-out pot. Example: idaṁ
naivedyaṁ klīṁ gaurāya svāhā – offer water into the
throw-out pot. Then continue offering the rest of the
articles such as pānīyaṁ, ācamanīyaṁ, etc. If one is not
performing Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa arcana, then the bhoga
offering plate is presented here to Śrī Gaurāṅga.]

Here, one should again offer āsana, pādya, and ācamana
as previously mentioned.

idaṁ naivedyaṁ klīṁ gaurāya svāhā – place tulasī leaves
on each preparation, and sprinkle the offering plate
(naivedya-pātra) with water from the conchshell

idaṁ pānīyaṁ klīṁ gaurāya svāhā – place tulasī leaves,
and sprinkle water from the conchshell into the drinking
cup (pānīya-pātra)

Arcana-dipika.txt                              5/5/2017

idaṁ ācamanīyaṁ klīṁ gaurāya svāhā – discharge water
into the throw-out pot

Then meditate on Śrīman Mahāprabhu sitting on His altar
with great satisfaction.

idaṁ tāmbūlaṁ klīṁ gaurāya svāhā – offer tāmbūla, or in
the absence of tāmbūla, offer a flower dipped in candana

idaṁ mālyaṁ klīṁ gaurāya svāhā – offer a garland to the
Deity

idaṁ sarvaṁ klīṁ gaurāya svāhā – offer flowers at His
lotus feet

After performing the worship as described above, chant
śrī-gaura-gāyatrī ten times. Then offer prayers and
praṇāma.

(Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 11.5.33)

O Śrīman Mahāprabhu! O protector of the surrendered
souls, Your lotus feet are the object of my constant
meditation. There is no restriction in regard to time
and place for Your meditation. You are the destroyer of
the insults received from one’s senses and family
members (in other words, You destroy the material
existence of the living entities). You are the supreme
abode of all tīrthas like Śrī Gauḍa, Śrī Vraja, and Śrī
Kṣetra-maṇḍala. You are the supreme shelter of the mahā-
bhāgavata devotees, who are followers of Śrīla Rūpa
Gosvāmī, in the Śrī Brahmā-Madhva-Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava line.
You are glorified by Lord Śiva in his incarnation as
Śrīman Advaita Ācārya, and by Lord Brahmā in his
incarnation as as nāmācārya Śrī Haridāsa Ṭhākura. You
removed the distress of a sheltered brāhmaṇa suffering
from leprosy, and You destroyed the ulterior desires for
material enjoyment from the hearts of Sārvabhauma
Bhaṭṭācārya and King Pratāparudra. You destroy the evil
paths of anyabhilāṣa, karma, jñāna, yoga, and so on,
which are the enemies of śuddha-bhakti. You are the
bestower of kṛṣṇa-prema. I worship Your lotus feet,
which are like a boat to help us cross the ocean of
nescience.

(Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 11.5.34)

I worship the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.
Appearing as a mahā-puruṣa, or exalted sage, who, in
order to keep true the words of a brāhmaṇa, retired to
the forest (accepted sannyāsa), renouncing His life and
soul, Śrīmatī Viṣṇu-priya-devī, who is the manifestation
of Śrī Lakṣmī. His compassion has no limit. Bestowing
His mercy freely on the fallen souls who are deeply
entangled in hankering after women, children, and
wealth, He immerses them in the ocean of kṛṣṇa-prema.

pañca-tattvātmakaṁ kṛṣṇaṁ bhakta-rūpa-svarūpakam

I offer praṇāma unto Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu in His five
features, as bhakta-rūpa, the form of a devotee
(Caitanya Mahāprabhu); bhakta-svarūpa, the expansion of
a devotee (Nityānanda Prabhu); bhakta-āvatāra, the
incarnation of a devotee (Śrī Advaita); bhakta, a pure
devotee (Śrī Śrīvāsa); and bhakta-śakti, the devotional
energy (Śrī Gadādhara).

Chapter Six

Arcana of Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa



[One may perform worship of Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa by using the
same paraphernalia, used in the arcana of śrī-gurudeva
and Śrī Gaurāṅga, but that paraphernalia should be
purified first with water from the pañca-pātra. The same
bathing pot, or snāna-pātra, that was used for Śrī
Gaurāṅga may be used for Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa.]

Begin the arcana of Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa by seeking the
permission and mercy of śrī-guru and Gaurāṅga. śrī-
gurudeva is a confidential servant and an intimate sakhī
of Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. “Gurudeva is engaged in the direct
service of Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa” – meditating on this, and
remembering one’s incapability, perform the arcana.
First meditate on Śrī Vṛndāvana.

Meditation on Śrī Vṛndāvana-dhāma

breezes cooled by the touch of the Yamunā’s waves and is
decorated with various types of flowers, creepers, and
trees. Its splendour is equal to that of millions of
suns, and it is ever free from the six waves of material
nature (namely lust, anger, greed, envy, false ego, and
illusion).

I meditate upon Śrīmatī Rādhikā and Śrīman Govinda-deva,
who are seated on an effulgent jewelled throne beneath a
desire tree in a temple composed of jewels within the
supremely beautiful land of Śrī Vṛndāvana. I meditate on
Them, accepting service from Their beloved sakhīs,
headed by Lalitā and Viśākhā.

I meditate on Śrī Kṛṣṇa (seated on the jewelled throne),
who possesses beautiful lotus eyes, whose bodily hue
resembles that of a fresh raincloud, who wears a yellow
silken dhoti, who has two arms, who plays the flute, who
wears beautiful forest garlands, who is adorned with
glittering ornaments, who is surrounded by the gopīs,
who embraces Śrīmatī Rādhikā, and whose body is composed
of transcendental consciousness and bliss.

śrī kṛṣṇaṁ śrī-ghana-śyāmaṁ pūrṇānanda-kalevaram

dvi-bhujaṁ sarva-deveśaṁ rādhāliṅgita-vigraham

I meditate on Śrī Kṛṣṇa, whose bluish-black colour
resembles that of a fresh raincloud, whose body is full
of transcendental bliss, who possesses two arms, who is
the Lord of all the demigods, and who is embraced by
Śrīmatī Rādhikā.

Performing Arcana of Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa

Chant the jaya-dhvani of Śrī Śrī Gāndhārvikā-Giridhārī
Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Vinodabihārījī three times. After mānasa-
pūjā, perform the worship of the Divine Couple, in the

                           65
Arcana-dipika.txt                               5/5/2017

form of the Deity or śrī śālagrāma-śilā, with external
articles. Like śrī-gaura-arcana, worship of Śrī Rādhā-
Kṛṣṇa should be performed with the mūla-mantra received
from śrī-gurudeva.[xxxvii]37 One should meditate, “I am
invoking Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa’s presence in Their appropriate
place and I am bathing them,” and then perform Their
arcana with the following mantras:

idaṁ āsanaṁ śrīṁ klīṁ rādhā-kṛṣṇābhyāṁ namaḥ – offer a
flower into the snāna-pātra for the purpose of an āsana

prabho! kṛpayā svāgataṁ kuru śrīṁ klīṁ rādhā-kṛṣṇābhyāṁ
namaḥ – with folded palms, invite Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa onto
the āsana situated in the snāna-pātra

etat pādyaṁ śrīṁ klīṁ rādhā-kṛṣṇābhyāṁ namaḥ – offer
water at Their lotus feet in the snāna-pātra

idaṁ arghyaṁ śrīṁ klīṁ rādhā-kṛṣṇābhyāṁ namaḥ – offer
arghya into the snāna-pātra

idaṁ ācamanīyaṁ śrīṁ klīṁ rādhā-kṛṣṇābhyāṁ namaḥ – offer
water into the throw-out pot

eṣa madhuparkaḥ śrīṁ klīṁ rādhā-kṛṣṇābhyāṁ namaḥ – offer
madhuparka into the snāna-pātra

idaṁ ācamanīyaṁ śrīṁ klīṁ rādhā-kṛṣṇābhyāṁ namaḥ – offer
water into the throw-out pot

idaṁ sugandha-tailaṁ śrīṁ klīṁ rādhā-kṛṣṇābhyāṁ namaḥ –
afterward, meditate on applying fragrant oil to the
limbs of the Divine Couple, and offer a flower dipped in
candana into the snāna-pātra

idaṁ snānīyaṁ śrīm śrīṁ klīṁ rādhā-kṛṣṇābhyāṁ namaḥ –
bathe Them with fragrant water from the conchshell,
while ringing the bell and reciting prayers; after
bathing Them, dry Their bodies with a soft cloth

idaṁ sottarīya-vastraṁ śrīṁ klīṁ rādhā-kṛṣṇābhyāṁ namaḥ
– offer two flowers into the throw-out pot, meditating
that one is offering Them clothes

idaṁ ācamanīyaṁ śrīṁ klīṁ rādhā-kṛṣṇābhyāṁ namaḥ – offer
water into the throw-out pot

Then meditate on the Divine Couple, sitting on Their
altar, feeling very satisfied. Touch Their lotus feet
and chant the mūla-mantra (śrī-kṛṣṇa-mantra and śrī-
rādhā-mantra). Afterward, chant:

idaṁ upavītaṁ klīṁ kṛṣṇāya namaḥ – offer the sacred
thread to Śrī Kṛṣṇa, or offer a flower dipped in candana

idaṁ tilakaṁ śrīṁ klīṁ rādhā-kṛṣṇābhyāṁ namaḥ –
meditating upon drawing tilaka marks on the Deities,
offer tulasī dipped in candana into the throw-out pot

idaṁ ābharaṇaṁ śrīṁ klīṁ rādhā-kṛṣṇābhyāṁ namaḥ –
meditate on decorating the Deities with ornaments and
offer a flower dipped in candana

eṣa gandha śrīṁ klīṁ rādhā-kṛṣṇābhyāṁ namaḥ – offer

                           66
Arcana-dipika.txt                               5/5/2017

candana at Their lotus feet

idaṁ sagandhaṁ puṣpaṁ śrīṁ klīṁ rādhā-kṛṣṇābhyāṁ namaḥ –
offer twice a flower dipped in candana at Their lotus
feet

etat tulasī-pātram śrīṁ klīṁ rādhā-kṛṣṇābhyāṁ namaḥ –
offer a tulasī leaf dipped in candana at the lotus feet
of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, and to the lotus hand of Śrī Rādhā

eṣa dhūpa śrīṁ klīṁ rādhā-kṛṣṇābhyāṁ namaḥ – offer
incense to the Divine Couple, or in absence, offer water
into the throw-out pot

eṣa dīpa śrīṁ klīṁ rādhā-kṛṣṇābhyāṁ namaḥ – offer the
lamp to Them, or in absence, offer water into the throw-
out pot

[If one is using only a single bhoga offering plate (for
multiple Deities), Śrī Gaurāṅga will simultaneously
partake here in the offering when it is offered to Śrī
Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. However, since the mantras for offering the
bhoga to Śrī Gaurāṅga were chanted previously in Śrī
Gaurāṅga arcana, there is no need to chant them here
again. If there are multiple bhoga offering plates, then
Śrī Gaurāṅga’s bhoga offering plate is given before,
during the arcana of Śrī Gaurāṅga. Afterwards, the
remnants of Śrī Gaurāṅga and Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa will be
offered to śrī-gurudeva.]

Here, one should again offer āsana, pādya, and ācamana
as previously done.

idaṁ naivedyaṁ śrīṁ klīṁ rādhā-kṛṣṇābhyāṁ namaḥ – place
tulasī leaves on each preparation and sprinkle water

the drinking cup (pānīya pātra)

Then, meditate on the Divine Couple sitting on Their
altar with great satisfaction.

tāmbūla, or in the absence of tāmbūla, alternatively

flowers at Their lotus feet

Chant the mūla-mantra and the kāma-gāyatrī-mantra ten
times each, and then chant the rādhā-gāyatrī ten times.

Chapter Eight

Worshiping Other Deities




Root mantras (mūla-mantras)

For each Deity, there is a mūla-mantra, or root mantra.
This mūla-mantra will be used throughout the day in the
performance of various services to the Lord. The mūla-
mantras are as follows:

Guru – aiṁ gurave namaḥ

Param-guru – oṁ parama-gurave namaḥ

Gaurāṅga – klīṁ gaurāya svāhā

Nityānanda – oṁ nityānanda namaḥ

Gaura and Nityānanda – oṁ klīṁ nityānanda-gaurāya svāhā

Gadadhara – śrīṁ gadādharāya namaḥ

Śālagrāma-śilā – oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya namaḥ

Govardhana-śilā – klīṁ govardhanāya namaḥ

Kṛṣṇa – klīṁ kṛṣṇāya namaḥ

Rādhā – śrīṁ rāṁ rādhikāyai namaḥ

Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa – śrīṁ klīṁ rādhā-kṛṣṇābhyāṁ namaḥ

Śrī Varāhadeva arcana

With the following mantra, one should perform the arcana
of Śrī Varāhadeva, as one does with Śrī Gaurāṅga:

oṁ namo bhagavate varāha-rupāya

I offer my obeiscences to Sri Bhagavān in the form of
Śrī Varāhadeva, the boar incarnation.

Arcana-dipika.txt                                5/5/2017

varāham

I meditate upon Lord Varāhadeva, whose legs, from His
lotus feet till His waist, are like golden pillars,
whose lotus face is like a blue lotus, and who is very
beautifully decorated with the Earth planet, situated
upon His tusks. In His two hands are the club and
discus, and His chest is reddish like the morning sun.
To that Bhagavān Varāhadeva, I offer my obeiscences.

Śrī Nityānanda arcana

Perform the worship of Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu by offering
Him all the articles used in the arcana of Śrī Gaurāṅga.
Use the following mantra: oṁ nityānandāya namaḥ. For
instance, to offer a seat to Śrī Nityānanda, one should
chant, idaṁ āsanaṁ oṁ nityānandāya namaḥ.

Meditation on Śrī Nityānanda (dhyāna)

(oṁ) vidyut-dāma-madābhimardana-ruciṁ vistīrṇa-vakṣa-

sarvānandakaraṁ paraṁ pravara-nityānanda-candraṁ bhaje

I worship Śrī Nityānanda-candra, who is unparalleled in
every respect, whose body displays an unprecedented
splendour which derides the splendour of lightning, who
has a broad chest, whose eyes are rolling with the
emotional ecstasies of prema, whose face is adorned with
a gentle smile, whose limbs are decorated with beautiful
ornaments, whose body is covered with a bluish garment,
and who grants the topmost bliss to everyone.

Praṇāma-mantra

saṅkarṣaṇaḥ kāraṇa-toya-śāyī



garbhoda-śāyī ca payobdhi-śāyī



śeṣaś ca yasyāṁśa-kalāḥ sa nityā-

Saṅkarṣaṇa, Śeṣa Nāga, and the Viṣṇus who lie on the
Kāraṇa Ocean, Garbha Ocean, and Kṣīra Ocean, are the
plenary portions and portions of the plenary portions of
Śrī Nityānanda Rāma. May He give me shelter.

Worship of Śrī Gaurāṅga and Śrī Nityānanda together

If one desires to worship Śrī Gaurāṅga and Śrī

                           79
Arcana-dipika.txt                               5/5/2017

Nityānanda together, one should perform the worship of
Śrī Gaura-Nityānanda by offering Them all the articles
used in the arcana of Śrī Gaurāṅga. For instance, to
offer a seat to Śrī Gaura-Nityānanda, one should chant,
idaṁ acamanīyaṁ oṁ klīṁ nityānanda-gaurāya svāhā.

Śrī Gaura-Nityānanda-praṇāma

ājānu-lambita-bhujau kanakāvadātau

saṅkīrtanaika-pitarau kamalāyātākṣau



viśvambharau dvija-varau yuga-dharma-pālau

vande jagat-priya-karau karuṇāvatārau



I worship the incarnations of mercy, Śrī Caitanya
Mahāprabhu and Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu, whose arms extend
to Their knees, whose eyes are large like lotus petals,
and whose complexions are enchanting and resplendent
with the luster of molten gold, who are the maintainers
of the entire universe, who appeared in the families of
exalted brāhmaṇas, and inaugurate the saṅkīrtana
movement, thus protecting the yuga-dharma and bestowing
the highest auspiciousness upon the residents of the
material world.

Worship of Śrī Gaurāṅga and Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa together

One may also worship both Śrī Gaurāṅga and Śrī Rādhā-
Kṛṣṇa simultaneously, by offering all of the
paraphernalia as in śrī-gaurāṅga-pūjā with the mantra,
klīṁ gaurāya svāhā śrīm klīṁ rādhā-kṛṣṇābhyāṁ namaḥ. For
instance, to offer a seat to both Śrī Gaurāṅga and Śrī
Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, one should chant idaṁ āsanaṁ klīṁ gaurāya
svāhā śrīm klīṁ rādhā-kṛṣṇābhyāṁ namaḥ.

Śrī Girirāja Govardhana arcana

Perform the worship of Śrī Girirāja Govardhana by
offering Him all the articles used in the arcana of Śrī
Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. Thus, to offer a seat to Śrī Girirāja, one
should chant idaṁ āsanaṁ klīṁ govardhanāya namaḥ.

One may perform the external worship of one’s Deities by
making the offerings to the govardhana-śilā, while
chanting the appropriate mūla-mantra for the worship of
the Deities. For example, when offering an āsana to Śrī
Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, one should chant, idaṁ āsanaṁ śrīṁ klīṁ
rādhā-kṛṣṇābhyāṁ namaḥ, and put a flower dipped in
candana in front of Girirāja into the snāna-pātra. In
this way one need not perform separate arcana for the
govardhana-śilā.

At the time of offering bath to Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, one
should bathe the govardhana-śilā while chanting idaṁ
snānīyaṁ śrīṁ klīṁ rādhā-kṛṣṇābhyāṁ namaḥ; and in this
way, Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa and Girirāja are both considered
bathed. After bathing, one should dry the govardhana-
śilā with a cloth, without touching the śilā with the

                           80
Arcana-dipika.txt                               5/5/2017

left hand, though one may hold the śilā with a cloth in
the left hand. After this, all the remaining articles
should be offered directly to Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa and to the
govardhana-śilā. For example, one should chant eṣa
gandhaḥ śrīṁ klīṁ rādhā-kṛṣṇābhyāṁ namaḥ, and offer
gandha to both Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa and Girirāja. In absence
of any articles, one should offer the articles mentally
by chanting the appropriate mantras, while discharging
water into the throw-out pot. In this way, the arcana of
Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa and Girirāja are considered to be
simultanously performed.

Śrī-śālagrāma-śilā arcana

The worship of śrī-śālagrāma-śilā or any other śilā-
mūrti should take place after the performance of śrī-
guru-pūjā. Bathe the śilā with scented water from the
bathing conch, or with pañcāmṛta on special occasions,
while reciting the śrī-puruṣa-sūkta-mantra, ringing the
bell, and blowing the conchshell. (The procedures for
bathing with pañcāmṛta were given earlier). Deities who
are difficult to bathe with water, etc., should be
bathed mentally. While bathing the Deity, one should not
touch the Deity with the left hand.

One may perform the external worship of one’s Deities by
making the offerings to the śālagrāma-śilā while
chanting the appropriate mūla-mantras for the worship of
the Deities. For example, when offering an āsana to Śrī
Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, one should chant idaṁ āsanaṁ śrīṁ klīṁ
rādhā-kṛṣṇābhyāṁ namaḥ, and put a flower dipped in
candana in front of the śālagrāma-śilā into the snāna-
pātra. In this way one need not perform separate arcana
for the śālagrāma-śilā. At the time of offering bath to
the Deity, bathe the śālagrāma-śilā, and then dry the
śilā with a cloth, without touching the śilā with the
left hand, though one may hold the śilā with a cloth in
the left hand. After bathing, all the remaining articles
should be offered directly to both the Deity and the
śālagrāma-śilā. (For example, when offering a garland to
the Deity, one should also offer one to the śālagrāma-
śilā.) In the absence of any articles, one should offer
them mentally by chanting the appropriate mantras, while
discharging water into the throw-out pot. In this way,
arcana of the Deity and the śālagrāma-śilā are performed
simultaneously.

Rules for worshiping of the Lord by the puruṣa-sūkta-
mantra

While chanting this mantra, offer an āsana to the Lord.

oṁ sahasra-śīrṣā puruṣaḥ sahasrākṣaḥ sahasra-pāt

sa bhūmiṁ viśvato vṛtvā ‘ty-atiṣṭhad daśāṅgulam (1)

With this mantra, one should invoke the Deity into the
snāna-pātra.

oṁ puruṣa evedaṁ sarvaṁ yad bhūtaṁ yac ca bhavyam

Hiraṇyagarbha, who is the Supersoul of this universe, is
the second puruṣa-avatāra and endowed with unlimited
heads, eyes, and feet. He pervades the entire universe
and is also simultaneously situated in a superior
position to the Supersoul within the heart of the living
entity. (1)[xxxviii]38

The entire universe, in the past, present, and future,
is none other than the puruṣa or His plenary portions.
The puruṣa Himself is the Lord of immortality; that is,
He is beyond this temporary material creation, which is
maintained by grains, and He remains existing after the
destruction of this material creation. (2)

The glory or majesty of this puruṣa is such that the
temporary material creation is but one-quarter of the
total majesty of the puruṣa. The remaining three-
quarters of His majesty exists as an eternal
transcendental abode named Vaikuṇṭha, beyond this
illusory creation. Still, the puruṣa Himself is greater
than the sum total of all His majesties. (3)

The puruṣa is eternally present in His transcendental
abode Vaikuṇṭha, which is the realm comprising three-
quarters of His majesty. In this mundane sphere, the
one-quarter portion of His majesty repeatedly manifests.
Thus He has displayed His excellence by pervading both
the eternal immortal world as well as the temporary
mortal world. (4)[xxxix]39

From the puruṣa, the gigantic form, or virāṭ-rūpa (in
the form of the universe) came into being. The puruṣa,
who is endowed with thousands of heads, is the presiding
Deity of this gigantic form. This virāṭ-rūpa is always
superior to the universe. This means that the entire
universe, before and after its creation, has no separate
existence from the manifest virāṭ-rūpa. (5)

The puruṣa is the embodiment of the oblations for

                           83
Arcana-dipika.txt                               5/5/2017

sacrifice. From this puruṣa, the embodiment of
sacrifice, all eatables have come into existence. Both
animals and birds dwelling either in the forest,
villages, or in the air were produced by Him. (6)[xl]40

From this puruṣa, who is the embodiment of sacrifice and
who is worshipable by everyone, the Ṛg, Sāma, Yajur, and
Atharva Vedas have come into existence. (7)

From the puruṣa who embodies sacrifice, horses and
living entities possessing two rows of teeth, all types
of cows, goats, and birds have come into being. (8)

In the beginning, those suitable for performing
sacrifice placed the sacrificial ingredients
[representing the puruṣa] on kuśa grass, and sprinkled
them with water for purification. Thus, by the puruṣa,
who is the embodiment of sacrifice (yajña-rūpa), or in
otherwords, by the sacrificial ingredients, the sages
and demigods were able to perform yajña. (9)

When within their minds, the demigods and the yogīs who
have seen the truth, conceived of the puruṣa in the
gigantic form of the universe, in how many ways did they
imagine His each and every limb? How is one to perceive
this gigantic form? What is stated about His face,
hands, thighs, and feet? (10)

The great sages conceived the brāhmaṇas to be the face
of the puruṣa, the kṣatriyas to be His two arms, and the
vaiśyas to be His two thighs. The śūdras were born from
His feet. (11)

From the mind of the puruṣa, Candra, the moon-god, came
into existence; from His eyes, Sūrya the sun-god; from
His face, Indra the king of the demigods and Agni the
fire-god; and from His breath, Vāyu the wind-god took
birth. (12)

From His navel, the space between Earth and heaven
(antarīkṣa, or bhuvar-loka) came into existence; from
His head, the heavens (svarga-loka); from His feet, the
Earth (bhu-loka); and from His ears, the ten directions
were produced. Thus, the yogīs conceived the fourteen
planetary systems in the body of the virāṭ-puruṣa. (13)

The sacrifice was accomplished by the demigods through
the puruṣa, who was the ingredients for the sacrifice.

In this sacrifice, the ghee was the spring season, wood
was the summer season, and the other ingredients were
the autumn season. (14)

In the yajña performed by the demigods, the sacrificial
animal [representing the puruṣa] was bound just as a
domesticated animal is bound with a rope. The seven
circumferences of the sacrifice were the seven Vedic
meters headed by gāyatrī, and the fuel sticks were
twenty-one (twelve months, six seasons, and the three
worlds). (15)

Through the performance of yajña, the demigods worshiped
the yajña-puruṣa. This performance of sacrifice (worship
of the Supreme Lord) is the sole primary occupation of

                           84
Arcana-dipika.txt                               5/5/2017

everyone. By the mercy of the puruṣa (Garbhodakaśāyī
Viṣṇu), these demigods attained the same destination of
the heavenly planets, where the sages of previous ages
reached and are presently serving. (16)

Chapter Nine

Noontime Offering and ārati (Madhyāhna-bhoga)



Before offering bhoga, the crown, flute, etc., of the
Deity should be removed. A tulasī leaf should be placed
on each and every bhoga preparation.[xli]41 First one
should offer the bhoga to Śrī Gaurāṅga, then to Śrī
Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, and then to śrī-gurudeva.


If one does not offer bhoga to Śrī Rādhā and Śrī Kṛṣṇa

                           87
Arcana-dipika.txt                               5/5/2017

together, then one must offer Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s remnants first
to Śrī Rādhā. We should offer the bhoga with a feeling
that śrī-gurudeva himself is offering the bhoga to
Śrīman Mahāprabhu and Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa.

Procedure

Bring in the bhoga to be offered, setting it up in front
of the altar. Ringing the bell, one should chant:

eṣa puṣpāñjaliḥ klīṁ kṛṣṇāya namaḥ – offer puṣpāñjaliḥ,
a few flower petals, at the lotus feet of each Deity

idaṁ āsanaṁ klīṁ kṛṣṇāya namaḥ – offer flowers on the
āsana

etat pādyaṁ klīṁ kṛṣṇāya namaḥ – offer water into the
throw-out pot

idaṁ ācamanīyaṁ klīṁ kṛṣṇāya namaḥ – offer water into
the throw-out pot

īdaṁ anna-vyañjana-pānīyādikaṁ sarvaṁ klīṁ kṛṣṇāya namaḥ
– one should place a tulasī leaf and put a drop of water
from the conchshell onto each preparation and offer the
bhoga

Also, one can offer the bhoga to Śrī Rādhā and Śrī Kṛṣṇa
together by using the mantras above, but with the mūla-
mantra, śrīm klīṁ rādhā-kṛṣṇābhyāṁ namaḥ. For example:
eṣa puṣpāñjaliḥ śrīm klīṁ rādhā-kṛṣṇābhyāṁ namaḥ.

Placing the sacred thread around one’s thumb, one should
put his right hand over the plate, cover his right hand
with the left hand, and, counting on the fingers, chant
the mūla-mantra eight times. After coming out of the
Deity room, one should chant the gaura-gāyatrī ten times
and kāma-gāyatrī ten times, and wait until Śrī Kṛṣṇa has
accepted the meal. Meanwhile, perform kīrtana with the
following bhoga-ārati song:

Bhoga-ārati kīrtana

bhaja bhakata-vatsala śrī-gaurahari



śrī gaurahari so hi goṣṭha-bihārī,

bagala bājāya āra deya hari bolo (9)

rādhikādi gaṇe heri nayanera koṇe

tṛpta haye khāya kṛṣṇa yaśodā-bhavane (10)

Clapping three times, enter into the Deity room, and
offer ācamanīya and tāmbūla. There is no fault in seeing
the bhoga offering while performing pūjā. After leaving
the Deity room, continue the kīrtana:

bhojanānte piye kṛṣṇa suvāsita vāri

sabe mukha prakṣālaya haye sāri sāri (11)

hasta-mukha prakṣāliyā jata sakhā-gaṇe

ānande viśrāma kare baladeva-sane (12)

Arcana-dipika.txt                                5/5/2017

mane mane sukhe rādhā-kṛṣṇa-guṇa gāya (16)

hari-līlā ek-matra jāhāra pramoda

bhogārati gāya sei bhaktivinoda (17)

Just worship Śrī Gaurahari, who is always affectionate
towards His devotees. He is none other than Kṛṣṇa, who
roamed with the cows from forest to forest, and who
stole the hearts of Nanda and Yaśodā. (1)

Yaśodā-maiyā calls, “O Dāmodara, it is very late. Please
come right now. Sit down to take Your meal in the dining
pavilion (bhoga-mandira).” (2)

Upon Nanda Bābā’s order, Kṛṣṇa, who lifted Govardhana
Hill, sits down. Then all the sakhās, along with
Baladeva, sit down in rows to take their lunch. (3)

Then they are given fried mung and urad dahl patties,
capātīs, and rice with ghee. They are served a feast of
śuktā and various kinds of green leafy vegetables, then
nice fried things, and a salad made of jute leaves. They
are

also served pumpkin, baskets of fruit, squash cooked in
milk with sugar (luk-lauki), thick yoghurt, and banana
flower sabjī. (4)

Next, sweets made with milk, sugar, and sesame, rice-
flour pancakes, thick condensed milk, sweet rolls, and
sweet rice. (5)

There is amṛta-keli scented with camphor, which is so
tasteful and more than sweet. There is sweet rice cooked
with bananas, and also amṛta rasālā. The boys are also
served twelve kinds of sour preparations made with
tamarinds, tomatoes, limes, lemons, oranges, and
pomegranates. (6)

There are purīs with sugar, purīs filled with cream,
lāḍḍus, and dahl patties boiled in sugar-water. Kṛṣṇa
very joyfully eats all of the preparations. (7)

In supreme bliss Kṛṣṇa takes the rice, various curried
vegetables, and sweets cooked by Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. (8)

Kṛṣṇa’s funny brāhmaṇa friend, Madhumaṅgala, who is very
fond of lāḍḍus, gets them by hook or by crook. As he
eats a lāḍḍu, he makes a funny sound by slapping his
hand under his armpit and calls out, “Give me more! Hari
bol!” (9)

Beholding Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī and Her sakhīs out of the

                           90
Arcana-dipika.txt                               5/5/2017

corners of His eyes, Kṛṣṇa takes His lunch at Yaśodā-
maiyā’s house with great satisfaction. (10)

After lunch, Kṛṣṇa drinks rose-scented water. Then all
the sakhās, standing in lines, wash their mouths. (11)

After washing their hands and mouths, all the sakhās
take rest in great bliss with Baladeva. (12)

Then, the sakhās Jāmbula and Rasāla bring Kṛṣṇa spiced
betel nuts. After chewing that, Kṛṣṇacandra happily goes
to sleep. (13)

While Kṛṣṇa contentedly sleeps on His beautiful bed, His
servant Viśālākṣa cools Him, sometimes with a peacock-
feather fan and sometimes with a camara. (14)

Upon Yaśodā-maiyā’s request, Dhaniṣṭha brings the
remnants of food left on Kṛṣṇa’s plate to Śrīmatī
Rādhikā, who takes them with great delight. (15)

Receiving Her remnants, Lalitā-devī and all the other
sakhīs, very deeply overjoyed, sing the glories of
Rādhikā and Kṛṣṇa. (16)

Ṭhākura Bhaktivinoda, who finds joy only in the pastimes
of Hari, sings this Bhoga-ārati song. (17)

Afterward, clapping three times, again enter into the
Deity room. First of all, one should offer Śrī Kṛṣṇa’s
prasāda to Śrīmatī Rādhikā, and then offer the prasāda
and nirmālya (garlands and flower remnants) to śrī-
gurudeva for him to offer to all the sakhīs, all the
Vaiṣṇavas, Paurṇamāsī, and all the Vrajavāsīs. (Refer to
the procedure mentioned in the section on upāṅga-pūjā to
offer the garlands, flower remnants, etc.)

After the bhoga offering, place the crown, vaṁśī
(flute),

and other ornaments on the Deity, and perform the bhoga-
ārati. The procedure for the bhoga-ārati is the same as
for maṅgala-

ārati mentioned previously. However, one can also use
camphor in the lamp (this is only permissible for bhoga-
ārati). In the madhyāhna, midday, ārati, offering a
camphor lamp is excellent; or at least one can sprinkle
camphor on the wicks of the

pañca-pradīpa. This also helps the pūjārī quickly light
the ghee wicks.

Putting Śrī Bhagavān to rest (śayana of Śrī Bhagavān)

After the ārati, remove the crowns, vaṁśī, and other
ornaments from the Deities, and pray to Them to lay down
on Their bed for śayana, or rest, by saying:

āgaccha śayana-sthānaṁ priyābhiḥ saha keśava

divya puṣpātya-śayyāyāṁ sukhaṁ vihara mādhava

O Keśava, kindly come to Your bed along with Your

                           91
Arcana-dipika.txt                              5/5/2017

beloved Śrīmatī Rādhikā. O Mādhava, this effulgent bed
of fragrant flowers is made for Your joyful sporting.

Then invite śrī-gurudeva to his resting place with the
following mantra:

āgaccha viśrāma-sthānaṁ sva-gaṇaiḥ saha śrī guroḥ

O Gurudeva, kindly come to your resting place along with
all your associates.

After this, place a tray of fragrant drinks, tāmbūla
with camphor, a garland, and some flowers next to the
bed of the Deities. After paying prostrated obeisances,
close the

temple doors.

After completing the arrangements for putting Śrī Guru-
Gaurāṅga and Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa to rest, pay obeisances to

mahā-prasāda and honour it after chanting the glories of
mahā-prasāda, nāma-saṅkīrtana, and jaya-dhvani. After
honouring prasāda in the association of Vaiṣṇavas,
participate in iṣṭa-goṣṭhī, read with proper
understanding the bhakti-śāstras, and complete the
chanting of a fixed number of rounds of harināma-japa.

Afternoon duties (aparāhna-kṛtya)

The Deities should be awakened according to the rules of
awakening as prescribed for the early morning. Then
offer the Deities fragrant drinks and a little quantity
of bhoga. Put the ornaments back on the Deities, and
then open the temple doors for darśana.

Evening duties (sāyaṁ-kṛtya)

In the evening time, after completing chanting of the
gāyatrī-mantras, perform the sandhyā-ārati of Śrī Śrī
Guru-Gaurāṅga and Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa with heartfelt
devotion. This ārati is performed like the madhyāhna
bhoga-ārati. After the completion of ārati, there should
certainly be recitation of devotional literature and
performance of kīrtana.

Nighttime duties (rātri-kṛtya)

Within the first prahara (one prahara is a duration of
three hours) of the night, offer bhoga to the Deities,
perform śayana-ārati and then put Them to rest. The
procedure for putting them to rest is the same as for
the afternoon śayana (see section Śayana of Śrī
Bhagavān). Honour mahā-prasāda, chant harināma, and then
take rest.




Chapter Ten

Special Instructions to be Followed


                           92
Arcana-dipika.txt                               5/5/2017


Before attending maṅgala-ārati, one should take off the
clothes worn during the night and change into fresh
clothes.[xlii]42

It is improper to extinguish the lit lamp when the
Deities are put to rest, or any other time when its
purpose is over (let it extinguish by itself). After
using the lamp once, it should be properly washed before
using it for the next arcana of Śrī Bhagavān.

When the conchshell is blown, it becomes contaminated by
saliva. Therefore, it should not be washed in the
ācamana-pātra, but should be taken out of the Deity room
and washed in a separate pātra, or throw-out pot.

After passing stool, one should bathe with water and
soap before entering the temple.

Flowers which are offered to any demigod, touched to
one’s forehead, brought in lower-body garments or washed
in ordinary water cannot be used for the worship of Śrī
Hari.

Without being initiated into the śrī-kṛṣṇa-mantra, one
doesn’t possess the qualification to worship Śrī
Bhagavān.

Without wearing the mark of viṣṇu-tilaka on one’s body,
all activities such as japa, homa (sacrifice), tāpa
(austerities), svādhyāya (study of śāstra), oblations
unto the forefathers, and performance of the śrāddha
ceremony become fruitless. A Vaiṣṇava must wear tilaka
on his body every day. At whatever time a person dies,
even if he is a caṇḍāla, or dog eater, if his body is
decorated with ūrdhva-puṇḍra, he goes to Vaikuṇṭha. If a
Vaiṣṇava wearing tilaka honours mahā-prasāda at
someone’s home, then Bhagavān liberates his hosts’
previous twenty generations from hell.



Length of the mark of tilaka or the ūrdhva-puṇḍra

The ūrdhva-puṇḍra which is equal to the breadth of one’s
ten fingers is considered the topmost (uttama). Ūrdhva-
puṇḍra equal to the breadth of one’s nine fingers is
moderate (madhyama), and that equal to the breadth of
one’s eight fingers is not considered up to the standard
(kaniṣṭha). The tilaka should be drawn from three-
quarters of the way down the nose up to the beginning of
the hairline. If someone applies tilaka with the ring
finger, he gets the desired result; applying tilaka with
the middle finger increases one’s duration of life;
applying tilaka with the index finger grants liberation,
and applying tilaka with the thumb results in
nourishment.

One should offer obeisances keeping Śrī Viṣṇu to one’s
left, Gaurī Śaṅkara to one’s right, and śrī-gurudeva to
the front. Otherwise, the praṇāma goes in vain.

Offenses (aparādha)

Bhakti-sādhakas, and especially those engaged in the
worship of the Deity, should become completely free from
offenses towards the service of the Deity (sevā-
aparādha) and offenses towards the holy name (nāma-
aparādha). They should remain extremely careful at all
times to not commit these offenses.

Aratī Songs and Other Prayers

Glories of Śrī Mahā-prasāda (śrī mahā-prasāda-māhātmya)

To be sung before honouring mahā-prasāda:

mahā-prasāde govinde

Those who have very few pious activities to their credit
can never develop faith in mahā-prasāda, in Śrī Govinda,
in the holy name of the Lord, or in the Vaiṣṇavas.

O Brother, this material body is a lump of ignorance,
and the senses are a network of paths leading to death.
We have fallen into this ocean of material sense
enjoyment – of all the senses the tongue is the most
difficult to control, being always greedy to taste
things. But Brother, Kṛṣṇa is so merciful that He gives
us His prasāda, the remnants from His own mouth, to help
us conquer the tongue.

This prasāda is full of nectar. Honoring this prasāda,
sing the glories of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, and with love call
for the help of Caitanya-Nitāi.

O brothers! One day at Śrī Advaita’s house in Śāntipura,
Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Nityānanda Prabhu were
seated at prasāda. When Mahāprabhu tasted the green
vegetables, He said, “My devotees, this śāka is so
delicious! Śrī Kṛṣṇa has definitely tasted it. At the
taste of such śāka as this, love of Kṛṣṇa arises in the
heart. In such love of God, you should take this
prasāda. Giving up all materialistic conceptions and
taking Bhagavān’s prasāda, all of you just chant ‘Hari!
Hari!’”

O brothers! Whenever Mādhavendra Purī took prasāda in
the courtyard of Mother Śacī, uncontrollable ecstatic
symptoms of kṛṣṇa-prema overwhelmed him while he ate.

O assembled sannyāsīs, just listen to this. Mother Śacī
cooked and prepared semi-solid preparations made with
banana flowers, a special lentil preparation, baskets of
fruits, small square cakes made of lentils and cooked-
down milk, and many other varieties of prasāda.

Seeing her pure devotion, Śrī Kṛṣṇa personally ate all
these different vegetable preparations, which were just
like nectar. All the results which the mystic obtains in
the execution of yoga will be obtained today in taking
Bhagavān’s prasāda. O brothers! Everyone simply eat the
prasāda of Śrī Hari and chant His holy name. The entire
universe glorifies and praises kṛṣṇa-prasāda. Obtaining
that prasāda, Mahādeva Śiva dances in great joy.

Śrī Yugala-āratī

Composed by Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura

jaya jaya rādhā-kṛṣṇa yugala-milana

perform the ārati ceremony for Their pleasure.

In His beautiful threefold bending form, He is so
attractive, even to Cupid. With His yellow silk dhotī
and crown decorated with peacock feathers, He captivates
the minds of all.

lalita-mādhava-vame vṛṣabhānu-kanyā

nīla-vasanā gaurī rūpe guṇe dhanyā (3)

To the left of the amorous and charming Śrī Mādhava is
the beautiful daughter of King Vṛṣabhānu, Śrīmatī
Rādhikā, dressed in a sārī the colour of a blue lotus.
Her complexion is the colour of molten gold and Her
beauty and qualities are matchless.

nānā-vidha-alaṅkāra kare jhalamala



hari-mana-vimohana vadana ujjvala (4)



She is adorned with various sparkling, shimmering
ornaments (alaṅkāras), enchanting the mind of Hari with
Her radiant face.

rādhe, rādhe, rādhe, bole, cāmara ḍhulāya re)

Viśākhā leads all the sakhīs in singing various rāgas
(melodious songs according to the appropriate time of
the day), as all the other priya-narma-sakhīs soothe
Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa with cāmara fans.

śrī-rādhā-mādhava pada sarasija-āśe

bhakativinoda sakhī-pade sukhe bhāse (6)

At the feet of the damsels of Vraja-dhāma lies an ocean
of joy. There, Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura swims, hoping to

performs pastimes only with your leaves and manjarīs.

.…āyane, (course of the sun)

Prayers for the remembrance of Śrī Viṣṇu and for peace
and auspiousness (Maṅgala-śānti)

yaṁ brahma vedānta-vido vadanti



pare pradhānaṁ puruṣaṁ tathānye



viśvodgateḥ kāraṇaṁ isvaraṁ vā



tasmai namo vighna-vināśāya



(Bṛhad Viṣṇu Purāṇa)

Obeiscences unto Him, who is the destroyer of all
obstacles, who the knowers of Vedānta describe as the
Supreme Brahman, and who others describe as the
pradhāna, or totality of mundane elements. Some describe
Him as the Supreme Puruṣa, while others describe Him as
the Supreme Lord and the cause of the creation of the
universe.

oṁ tad viṣṇoḥ paramaṁ padaṁ sadā

paśyanti sūrayo divīva cakṣur-ātatam



(Sāma Veda)

Just as those with ordinary vision see the sun’s rays in
the sky, so the wise and learned devotees always see the
supreme abode of Lord Viṣṇu.

(oṁ) kṛṣṇo vai sac-cid-ānanda-ghanaḥ

kṛṣṇa ādi-puruṣaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ puruṣottamaḥ

kṛṣṇo ha u karmādi-mūlaṁ

yan maṅgalaṁ tal labhate kṛtī

(Śri Kṛṣṇa Upaniṣada)

Lord Kṛṣṇa is the colour of a new rain cloud. Therefore
He is compared to a transcendental cloud full of
eternity, bliss, and cognizance. He is the original and
Supreme Person. He is the origin of all activities and

Viṣṇu, and Śiva. Kṛṣṇa is without any beginning.
Whatever auspiciousness is found within or beyond this
universe, the devotee obtains in Kṛṣṇa alone.

(Bṛhad Viṣṇu Purāṇa)

The Supreme Lord Viṣṇu is all auspicious. Madhusūdana is
all auspicious. Hṛṣīkeśa is all auspicious. Hari is the
abode of all auspiciousness. Simply by saying the name
of Viṣṇu, or by remembering Kṛṣṇa, all obstacles are
destroyed and all auspiciousness comes. This is certain.

The Upadeśāvalī of Śrī Śrīmad Bhakti PrajÑāna Keśava
GosvāmīMahārāja ācārya keśarī (the lion-like ācārya)

Bhagavad-bhakti is attained by viśrambha-sevā, or
intimate service to the lotus feet of śrī-guru.

Honest service to Śrī Hari, śrī-guru, and the Vaiṣṇavas
is actual guru-sevā.

The aṅga of bhakti known as kīrtana is the best and
complete limb of bhakti.

Only through the medium of kīrtana are the other limbs
of bhakti accomplished.

Renouncing bad association is actual solitude, and
performing bhajana in the company of sādhus and
Vaiṣṇavas is the actual meaning of solitary bhajana.

Preaching hari-kathā always and everywhere is real hari-
kīrtana.

To speak hari-kathā always and everywhere, or to be
absorbed in speaking about services related to Śrī Hari,
is real silence.

Performing gaura-bhajana in the mood of rūpānuga is the
actual vipralambha-bhajana of Śrī Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa.

Taking shelter of the feet of a genuine guru, one should
serve Hari.

One should never give pain to any living entity by body,
mind, or words.

One should maintain his life by honest means.

One should always remember that Śrī Bhagavān is one, not
many.

Vrajendra-nandana Śrī Kṛṣṇa alone is Svayaṁ Bhagavān; He
is the possessor of all śakti and the origin of all
avatāras. Rendering service to Him is the primary duty
of all living entities; all other activities are
secondary.

Those people who consider that Bhagavān is formless are
atheists, and one should never associate with them.

Attaining prema for Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the real ultimate
objective of the jīva.

The service of Kṛṣṇa is our life, if performed for His
pleasure with a favourable attitude, devoid of all other
desires, not covered by jñāna and karma, and performed
by the body, mind, words, and all of the senses.

The Upadeśāvali of Śrī Śrīmad Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī
Gosvāmī Prabhupāda

“Paraṁ vijāyate śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtanam – supreme victory
to the congregational chanting of Kṛṣṇa’s names” – this
is the Śrī Gauḍīya Maṭh’s sole object of worship.

                          126
Arcana-dipika.txt                               5/5/2017


Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who is the viṣaya-vigraha, the object of the
devotee’s prema, is the sole enjoyer, and all others are
to be enjoyed by Him.

Those who don’t perform hari-bhajana are ignorant and
murderers of their own souls.

The acceptance of śrī-hari-nāma and direct realisation
of Bhagavān are one and the same.

Those who equate the demigods with Viṣṇu are unable to
serve Bhagavān.

Establishing a printing press to print devotional books,
and preaching by organising nāma-haṭṭa programmes,
constitutes genuine service to Śrī Māyāpura.

We are not doers of good or bad deeds, nor are we
scholars or illiterate. Carrying the shoes of Śrī Hari’s
pure devotees as our duty, we are initiates into the
mantra – kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hari.

Preaching without proper conduct falls within the
category of karma, mundane activity. Without criticising
the nature of others, one should correct one’s self –
this is my personal instruction.

Serving the Vrajavāsīs, who felt great separation from
Kṛṣṇa when He left Vraja to reside in Mathurā, is our
supreme constitutional occupation.

If we desire to follow an auspicious course in life,
then disregarding the theories of even countless people
we should only hear instructions from a transcendental
source.

Life as an animal, bird, insect, or any of the countless
thousands of species is acceptable, but taking shelter
of deceit is thoroughly improper. Only an honest person
possesses real auspiciousness.

Simple-heartedness is synonymous with Vaiṣṇavism.
Servants of a paramahaṁsa Vaiṣṇava should be simple-
hearted, a quality which makes them the topmost
brāhmaṇas.

Helping to draw conditioned souls away from their
perverted attachment to the material energy is the
greatest compassion. If even one soul is rescued from
Mahā-māyā’s fortress, that compassionate act is
infinitely more benevolent than the construction of
unlimited hospitals.

We have not come to this world to be construction
workers; we are the bearers of Śrī Caitanyadeva’s
instructions.

We will not remain in this world for long, and by pro-
fusely performing hari-kīrtana, upon relinquishing these
material bodies we will experience the ultimate reward
of embodied life.

The foot-dust of Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī, the fulfiller of Śrī

                          127
Arcana-dipika.txt                               5/5/2017

Caitanyadeva’s inner desires, is our lives’ sole desired
object.

If I were to desist from lecturing about the Absolute
Truth due to being fearful that some listeners may be
displeased, I would be deviating from the path of Vedic
truth and accepting the path of untruth. I would become
one who is inimical to the Vedas, an atheist, and would
no longer possess faith in Bhagavān, the very embodiment
of truth.

Kṛṣṇa’s darśana can only be attained through the medium
of the ear as one hears hari-kathā from pure Vaiṣṇavas;
there is no other way.

Wherever hari-kathā is being spoken is a holy place.

Proper śravaṇa, hearing, is accomplished through the
medium of kīrtana, and this will give one the good
opportunity to practice smaraṇa, remembrance. The
internal experience of rendering direct service to the
aṣṭa-kālīya-līlā, Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes in each of
the eight parts of the day, then becomes possible.

We should understand that the loud calling out of Śrī
Kṛṣṇa’s names is bhakti.

Bhagavān will not accept anything which is offered by a
person who doesn’t chant hari-nāma one-hundred thousand
times daily.

By sincerely endeavouring to chant harināma without
offences and remaining fixed in chanting constantly,
one’s offences will fade and pure harināma will arise on
the tongue.

As mundane thoughts arise while taking harināma, one
should not become discouraged. A secondary consequence
of taking harināma is that these useless mundane
thoughts will gradually dissipate; therefore, one should
not worry about this. By dedicating one’s mind, body,
and words to serving śrī-nāma, and continuing to chant
with great persistence, Śrī Nāmī Prabhu will grant one
darśana of His supremely auspicious transcendental form.
Through the power of śrī-nāma, by continuing to chant
until one’s anarthas are fully eradicated, realisation
of His form, qualities, and pastimes will automatically
arise.

[i] After passing stool, one should not touch anything
with the left hand (door, tap, towel, soap, etc.). One
should wash his hands with earth or soap, taking the
soap in the right hand, making it soapy, putting the
soap down and then rubbing ones right hand with the

                          128

left. This should be done a minimum two to three times.
One should not bathe naked nor in impure water. Also,
using oil after bathing is considered impure. One should
apply oil to oneís hair or body before taking bath. One
should not brush oneís teeth, shave, or cut ones nails
after bathing. While passing urine one should not stand
but should squat down and pass in such a manner as to
not contaminate ones cloth. After passing urine one
should purify oneself by first washing oneís genital,
hands, and feet with water, and then by rinsing oneís
mouth.




[ii] The śikhā should not be braided or kept untied and
disheveled. It is preferable to tie it with a slip knot.




[iii] One should also not enter the Deity room or the
kitchen with such contaminated cloth, nor should one
touch the Deity pharaphernelia and kitchen pots. Also
one should not clean the Deities’ pharaphernelia or wash
pots in one’s gamchā that was used for going to the
toilet, or wearing clothing slept in the night before.
In the glossary see also Prasādī and Jhuṭhā.




[iv] Pañca-pātra literally means ‘five containers,’
containing auspicious ingredients that are used in the
arcana of the Deity. The five containers are: (1) an
ācamana cup for the pūjārī; (2) śuddhodaka, purified
water; (3) pādya, footwash; (4) arghya, auspicious water
for welcoming; and (5) ācamana, mouthwash for the Deity.
Nowadays, these five containers are substituted by one
cup, containing water, and it is called pañca-pātra. The
pañca-pātra is also sometimes refered to as the ācamana
cup. The pūjārī should set aside one ācamana cup for
himself and one for the Deity. One should be careful not
to use the ācamana cup meant for the Deity for ones own
self, like performing ācamana or purifying ones hands
etc., and vice-versa, one should not use the ācamana cup
meant for oneself for the Deity, like purifying and
offering articles etc.




[v] Even in the absence of Ganges water one may mix soil
from the base of the tulasī plant into the water,
because all the holy waters of all holy places (tīrthas)
reside at the base of tulasī. Also, it is good practice
to use fresh water every day in one’s pañca-pātra,
because the water can get stale (begin to smell like
brass), or get dirty, and even insects may fall in. The
water in the pañca-pātra meant for the Deity should be

                          129
Arcana-dipika.txt                               5/5/2017

changed every day. If there is a tulasī leaf in the old
water, it may be thrown out into the garden or onto a
plant etc.




[vi] Do not apply tilaka in the bathroom. The tilaka
marking should not be too big, making it look clumsy, or
so small that you cannot see it. It shouldn’t be
crooked, or off-centred. The ball of tilaka should not
be dirty and it should not be kept in a box as a wet
paste. The tilaka paste should be feshly made and
applied every day while sitting, not standing.




[vii] One may first apply the tilaka to the different
parts of the body, and after finishing applying all the
tilakas, one should chant the below mentioned mantras
while touching each of the tilakas. In other words,
after you apply tilaka to all the parts, then you go
back and touch all those parts again. Alternatively, one
may chant the below mentioned mantras as he applies the
tilaka to the different parts of the body.




[viii] Upavīta (using the brāhmaṇa thread). The brāhmaṇa
thread is actually composed of three different threads,
each comprised of nine twisted strands.

It is received from śrī-guru at the time of the
upanayana-saṁskāra. Only men should wear the brāhmaṇa
thread. The brāhmaṇa thread represents the guru-
paramparā, and therefore, this thread is sacred and
should not get contaminated. While passing water or
stool, one should wrap the sacred thread around the
right ear three times. It is described in the scriptures
that since all the holy tīrthas reside in the right ear,
the thread remains pure in that position even as the
rest of the body becomes impure. While doing ācamana,
chanting gāyatrī, performing arcana, and offering bhoga,
etc., one should perform the worship with the thread

wrapped around the thumb of the right hand three times.
If the brāhmaṇa

thread is too short, then wrapping it around the thumb
once will suffice.

The brāhmaṇa thread should never come below the navel,
touch the ground, or touch ones feet. If the brāhmaṇa
thread gets contaminated or dirty, then one may clean it
with soap. If the thread gets cut or breaks, one should
change it with a new brāhmaṇa thread. One may also
change the thread if it gets too old, dirty or
contaminated. Auspicious days to change the thread are
Ekādaśī, Gaura-pūrṇimā, Guru-pūrṇimā, etc. To change the

                          130
Arcana-dipika.txt                              5/5/2017

thread, one should get a bona fide brāhmaṇa thread (made
by someone initiated by a sad-guru), wash it, and dry
it. Afterward, it should be given to the pūjārī who will
offer it to the lotus feet of Śrī Gaurāṅga, with a small
amount of candana applied to it. After receiving it one
should put on the thread before chanting one’s gāyatrī
and perform the gāyatrī with both the old and new
threads wrapped around the thumb of the right hand.
After finishing the gāyatrī, one should carefully take
off the old thread, passing by the feet without touching
them. One should then discharge the old thread by
putting it into a sacred river or pond.




[ix] While sipping water, one should not make a slurping
sound. Also, one should not contaminate the brāhmaṇa
thread by touching it to the mouth.




[x] Chanting the mantras given by the guru is also
called āhnika. They should be chanted after taking one’s
bath, putting on clean cloth, and during the proper
time. Sitting on a clean āsana, preferably made out of
wool, silk, or kuśa grass, one should apply tilaka and
perform ācamana. Then, facing the proper direction, one
should perform bhūta-śuddhi, the process of identifying
oneself as the servant of the servant of Kṛṣṇa (see
Chapter Three, Purification of Oneself), and proceed to
chant āhnika. One may also face the Deities while
chanting ones āhnika. Āhnika should not be chanted in a
contaminated condition or place. The brahma-gāyatrī must
be chanted during the three sandhyās of the day,
otherwise it will not bear fruit.




[xi] The bell that is hanging on the roof of the temple.
If there is no temple bell, one may ring a hand-held
bell or clap ones hands.




[xii] Generally an oil or ghee lamp is kept on the
altar, which is used for providing light for the
Deities, and also for lighting incense, ghee wicks, etc.
If one doesn’t have an oil lamp, one can provide light
by using a candle or an electric lantern. One should be
careful not to touch or perform worship of the Deities
in the dark.




                          131
Arcana-dipika.txt                               5/5/2017

[xiii] In the afternoon time one should chant the
following mantra to wake up the Deities, instead of the
mantra starting with go-gopa-gokulānanda…:
“uttiṣṭhottiṣṭha govinda uttiṣṭha parameśvara / uttiṣṭha
rādhā-kānta trailokya-maṅgalaṁ kuru –

O Govinda! O Parameśvara! Please arise, please arise. O
beloved of Srīmatī Rādhikā, please arise. Please
benedict the three worlds with Your auspicious glance.”




[xiv] To know what is ācamana, please refer to Chapter
Three, Offering water for mouth rinsing.




[xv] The throw-out pot is a container into which the
worshiper discharges water and flowers that are offered
to the Lord. Generally, in the absence of any item, one
may mentally meditate on the particular item and
substitute it by offering water from the pañca-pātra
into the throw-out pot. Each article or its substitute
(like a spoon of water from the ācamana cup) may be
presented first, before offering it, by lifting it up in
front of the Deity.




[xvi] While rotating the cloth in front of the Deity,
one should meditate upon cleaning the face, hands and
feet. For cleaning the floor and altar, separate cloths
should be used.




[xvii] For śrī-gurudeva and Śrīmatī Rādhārānī, put the
tulasī leaf on their hand.




[xviii] For incense chant, eṣa dhūpaḥ (and mūla-mantra);
for ghee lamp chant, eṣa dipaḥ (and mūla-mantra); for
water in the conch chant, idaṁ arghyam (and mūla-
mantra); for cloth chant, idaṁ vastram (and mūla-
mantra); for flowers chant, etāni puṣpāni (and mūla-
mantra); for whisk chant, eṣa cāmara sevā (and mūla-
mantra); for peacock fan chant, eṣa vyajana sevā (and
mūla-mantra); for general fan chant, eṣa vyajana sevā
(and mūla-mantra). These mantras are chanted when the
pūjārī offers the articles to the Deity during the ārati
song.

[xix] Only Kṛṣṇa in Vṛndāvana, who wears a peacock
feather, should be offered the peacock fan. Thus, even
Dvārakadhiśa or Mathureśa Kṛṣṇa should not be offered
the peacock fan.




[xx] One should offer the articles to tulasī before the
guru-paramparā and other Vaiṣṇavas.




[xxi] When the conchshell is blown, it becomes
contaminated by saliva. Therefore, it should be taken
out of the Deity room and washed in a separate container
or clean place. One should not wash the conchshell in
contaminated places like

the bathroom and toilet, or in places where the Deity
paraphernelia is used,

like the kitchen.




[xxii] Men may perform either type of praṇāma, but women
traditionally perform only pañcāṅga-praṇāma, since their
breasts should not touch the earth.




[xxiii] One should remember to first remove Kṛṣṇa’s
crown and flute etc., before beginning. Offer the
following articles to śrī-gurudeva, then to Śrī
Gaurāṅga, and then to Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. But eatables
(naivedya) should be offered to śrī-gurudeva only after
first offering it to Śrī Gaurāṅga and Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa.
Their remnants are then offered to śrī-gurudeva. For
example: one would first mentally offer puṣpāñjaliḥ,
āsana, pādyam, and ācamanīyam to śrī-gurudeva, then
physically offer these articles as shown below (by
offering water into the throw-out pot etc.). Afterwards,
one would offer puṣpāñjaliḥ, asana, pādyam, ācamanīyam,
and miṣṭānna-pānīyādikam to Śrī Gaurāṅga in one’s mind,
and then physically offer these articles as shown below.
At this time tulasī should also be put on the
preparations. From here one should proceed to offer
these articles to Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, as shown below,
followed by the chanting of the gopāla-mantra, while
keeping one’s right hand, covered by the left hand,
above the bhoga plate. For an example of how to offer
the following articles first to śrī-gurudeva etc.,
please see ‘Card 3.’

[xxiv] While using the conchshell, be careful not to
pour excessive water onto the bhoga, making it wet.
Instead one may also use water from the ācamana cup.




[xxv] One may also chant the gaura-mantra eight times
along with the gopāla-mantra.




[xxvi] One offers the remnants of Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa first
to śrī-gurudeva, who then takes the remnants and
distributes them to all the sakhīs and other associates.
After this, one meditates on śrī-gurudeva partaking in
the remnants.




[xxvii] When silently reciting one’s gāyatrī-mantras,
one should avoid making any sound or moving one’s lips.




[xxviii] When bathing tulasī, one generally offers her
three spoons of water from the ācamana cup, and recites
the above-mentioned snāna-mantra.




[xxix] The three items, candana (sandalwood), karpūra
(camphor), and aguru (scented aguru wood), mixed in a
particular ratio, comprise gandha. If all these
ingredients are not available, simple sandalwood paste
is sufficient. Camphor should not be used in the winter.
Synthetic camphor should not be used, for it gives a
burning sensation.




[xxx] Long nails are considered to be dirty and
contaminated. Therefore, it is a general practice of
pūjārīs to keep their fingernails short in order to
avoid sevā-aparādha, like contaminating the bhoga and
other various articles, meant for offering to the Lord.
Even during the four months of cāturmāsya, pūjārīs
should keep their nails short.

[xxxi] One may also save the reminder of this purified
water and use it later for arcana purposes. For example,
water for the ācamana cup, etc.




[xxxii] During the cold season, the bathing water should
be luke-warm. Also one should not perform bathing of
śrī-śālagrāma-śilā before sunrise.




[xxxiii] One should offer to śrī-gurudeva all the
sixteen articles mentioned below in sequence, first in
one’s mind and then physically. At this point, if one
has a Deity of śrī-gurudeva and wants to bathe him, then
one should place him into the bathing pot (snāna-pātra).
If one doesn’t have a Deity, one may place a picture of
śrī-gurudeva in front of the bathing pot, and showing
the articles to the picture, discharge them into the
bathing pot. If a bathing pot is not used, then they
should be discharged into the throw-out pot. Also, if a
Deity is made out of wood and one doesn’t want to get
him wet, then one may place a mirror in the bathing pot,
and bathe the Deity’s reflection by pouring the
substances onto the mirror.




[xxxiv] Generally one performs śrī-guru-pūjā, followed
by the arcana of Śrī Gaurāṅga and Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. At
that time, when one offers the incense physically to Śrī
Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, one also offers it to śrī-gurudeva;
therefore, here one may substitute incense by
discharging water into the throw-out pot.




[xxxv] Along with the offering plate, a cup of water is
always offered.



[xxxvi] One should offer to Śrī Gaurāṅga all the sixteen
articles mentioned below in sequence, first in one’s
mind and then physically. At this point, if one has a
Deity of Śrī Gaurāṅga and wants to bathe Him, then one
should place Him into the bathing pot (snāna-pātra). If
one doesn’t have a Deity, one may place a picture of Śrī
Gaurāṅga in front of the bathing pot and, showing the
articles to the picture, discharge them into the bathing

pot. If a bathing pot is not used, then they should be
discharged into the throw-out pot.



[xxxvii] One should offer to Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa all the
sixteen articles mentioned below in sequence, first in
one’s mind and then physically. At this point, if one
has Deities of Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa and one wants to bathe
Them, one should place Them into the bathing pot (snāna-
pātra). If one does not have Deities, one may place a
picture of Śrī Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa in front of the bathing pot
and, showing the articles to the picture, discharge them
into the bathing pot. If a bathing pot is not used, then
the articles should be discharged into the throw-out
pot.



[xxxviii] In Caitanya-caritāmṛta, Madhya-līlā 20.292,
published by Śrīla Bhaktivedānta Svāmī Mahārāja
‘Prabhupāda,’ it is stated: “Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, known
within the universe as Hiraṇyagarbha and the antaryāmī,
or Supersoul, is glorified in the Vedic hymns, beginning
with the hymn that starts with the word sahasra-śīrṣā.”
Also, Madhya-līlā 20.250-251 states: “In the beginning,
Kṛṣṇa incarnates Himself as the puruṣa-avatāras, or
Viṣṇu incarnations. These are of three types. Viṣṇu has
three forms called puruṣas. The first, Mahā-Viṣṇu, is
the creator of the total material energy (mahat), the
second is Garbhodaśāyī, who is situated within each
universe, and the third is Kṣīrodaśāyī, who lives in the
heart of every living being. He who knows these three
becomes liberated from the clutches of māyā.” In Madhya-
līlā 21.39-41 (including purport) it is further stated:
“Mahā-Viṣṇu, Padmanābha, and Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu are the
Supersouls of all subtle and gross existences. Lord
Mahā-Viṣṇu is known as Kāraṇodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, the
Supersoul of everything. Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, from
whose lotus navel Brahmā was created, is also called
Hiraṇyagarbha and is the total Supersoul and the subtle
Supersoul. Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu is the universal form and
the gross Supersoul. Although Mahā-Viṣṇu, Padmanābha,
and Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu are all shelters and controllers
of the entire universe, They are nonetheless but plenary
portions or portions of the plenary portions of [puruṣa-
uttama = Puruṣottama, the topmost puruṣa] Kṛṣṇa.
Therefore He is the original [puruṣa] Personality of
Godhead. The Brahmās and other lords of the mundane
worlds appear from the pores of Mahā-Viṣṇu and remain
alive for the duration of His one exhalation. I adore
the primeval Lord, Govinda, of whom Mahā-Viṣṇu is a
portion of a plenary portion.”



[xxxix] In Caitanya-caritāmṛta, Ādi-līlā 5.94-99 it is
stated: “After creating millions of universes, the first
puruṣa entered into each of them in a separate form, as
Śrī Garbhodakaśāyī. Entering the universe, He found only
darkness, with no place in which to reside. Thus He
began to consider. Then He created water from the
perspiration of His own body, and with that water filled
half the universe. The universe measures five hundred

                          136
Arcana-dipika.txt                              5/5/2017

million yojanas. Its length and breadth are one and the
same. After filling half the universe with water, He
made His own residence therein and manifested the
fourteen worlds in the other half. There, He manifested
Vaikuṇṭha as His own abode, and rested in the waters on
the bed of Lord Śeṣa.” In Ādi-līla 5.94-99 it is further
stated: “I offer my respectful obeisances unto the feet
of Śrī Nityānanda Rāma, whose secondary part is the
Viṣṇu, lying in the ocean of milk. That Kṣīrodakaśāyī
Viṣṇu is the Supersoul of all living entities and the
maintainer of all the universes. Śeṣa Nāga is His
further subpart. The material planets rest within the
stem that grew from the lotus navel of Lord Nārāyaṇa.
Among these planets are seven oceans. There, in part of
the ocean of milk, lies Śvetadvīpa, the abode of the
sustainer, Lord Viṣṇu. He is the Supersoul of all living
entities. He maintains this material world, and He is
its Lord.”



[xl] Because these descriptions are indirect and
purposfully difficult to understand, one will have to
reconcile by hearing from śrī-guru and Vaiṣṇavas. If one
truly desires to understand, he must inquire, reconcile,
and do bhajana. The virāṭ-rūpa, or Universal Form, is
embodied by the universe. Thus ultimately, anything one
offers to the Lord, using ingredients from this
universe, is like worshiping the Gaṅgā by pouring Gaṅgā
water back into her. Ultimateley there is nothing
separate from the Lord, and therefore He is called
Advaya, one, without a second.



[xli] If one does not have many tulasī leaves, one may
place one tulasī leaf on one of the preparations in the
middle of the plate. One can then meditate on placing
tulasī on all the other preparations.



[xlii] One should not sleep naked. Sleeping towards East
is favorable for knowledge and towards South is
favourable for strength. Avoid sleeping towards the West
which bring worries and North which produces illness.



[xliii] Here one states for which purpose one is
performing the saṅkalpa. After saying “for all kinds of
aupiciousness and…” one can say, “(1) out of love and
devotion for the Lord; or (2) out of love and devotion
for śrī-śrī-guru-gaurāṅga-gāndharvikā-giridhārī-rādhā-
vinoda-bihārījī; or (3) for the purpose of homage to the
deceased; or (4) for the purpose of a Vaiṣṇava fire
sacrifice and worship of the Lord; or (5) for the
purpose of my objective, meaning, for any other purpose
one may have, that is not mentioned here.”
